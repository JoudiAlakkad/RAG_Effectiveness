What was the difference in views between Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and her predecessor Thuli Madonsela on the terms of reference of the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture?,"The article does not explicitly state what the exact difference is between the two women's views. However, it mentions that Thuli Madonsela told News24 earlier on Wednesday that the inquiry may only focus on state capture allegedly committed by the Zuma and Gupta families, implying that she believes the terms of reference should be narrow. In contrast, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane called for a ""wider probe into state capture"" in her statement, suggesting that she believes the terms of reference should be broader.","In 2018, it was reported that the public protector's office had drafted a report on state capture which included findings that the President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, had committed the most serious crimes under international law. The public protector's draft terms of reference for the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture were different from those proposed by the incumbent then public protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane's predecessor, Thuli Madonsela.

Thuli Madonsela's proposal was that the commission would have an independent counsel appointed to oversee the investigation. On the other hand, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's draft terms of reference were not approved by Parliament and she withdrew them following public outcry over allegations of bias against her in relation to those terms.

What is the function of the BK-channel blocker GAL021 in relation to opioid-induced respiratory depression?,"According to the text, GAL021 is a respiratory stimulant that acts as a blocker of the BK (Potassium) channel, specifically expressed on type 1 carotid body cells. Its function is to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression by stimulating breathing without interacting with the opioid system and compromising its analgesic efficacy.","GAL021, also known as 4-[(5-amino-2-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-1,3-diphenylbutane hydrochloride, is a selective blocker of the large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel.

BK channels play a role in regulating various physiological processes, including neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. In the context of opioid-induced respiratory depression, BK channel blockade by GAL021 may have several potential effects:

1. Reduced potassium efflux: By blocking BK channels, GAL021 can reduce the outward flow of potassium ions (K+) from neurons. This can lead to an increase in intracellular potassium levels, which can hyperpolarize neurons and reduce their excitability.
2. Increased neuronal excitability: The blockade of BK channels can also lead to a decrease in the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as GABA, which can further contribute to increased neuronal excitability.
3. Enhancement of opioid-induced analgesia: GAL021 may enhance the analgesic effects of opioids by reducing the activity of neurons that would normally counteract their effects.

While GAL021 has shown promise in preclinical studies for treating opioid-induced respiratory depression, its clinical efficacy and safety have not been extensively evaluated in humans. Further research is needed to determine the full potential of this compound and its suitability for therapeutic use."
Where did the culture of drag racing originate?,"There is no mention of the origin of the culture of drag racing in the provided context. The text only discusses the band Hercules & Love Affair and their music, as well as a comparison to other songs like ""London Calling"" by The Clash.","The culture of drag racing originated in the United States, specifically in the post-World War II era. The term ""drag racing"" was first used to describe a type of street racing that took place on public roads, often at night and with modified vehicles.

One of the earliest recorded instances of drag racing occurred in the 1930s in Southern California, particularly in Los Angeles County. At that time, street racers would gather in parking lots and on streets to compete with each other, often using their cars as a means of transportation and competition.

However, it was during the 1940s and 1950s that drag racing began to take shape as a distinct culture and sport. The first organized drag racing event is credited to be held at the Muroc Army Air Field in California in 1949, which later became the famous Dry Lakes Racetrack.

The growth of drag racing was fueled by the rise of American automobile culture in the 1950s, including the popularity of hot rods and custom cars. The sport also gained popularity through media coverage, with films like ""American Graffiti"" (1973) showcasing the thrill and excitement of street racing.

In the early 1960s, organized drag racing events began to take place at dedicated tracks, such as the famous Route 66 in California and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) was founded in 1951, and it played a significant role in promoting and organizing drag racing events.

Today, drag racing is a global sport with various forms of competition, including professional and amateur events, and has become an integral part of popular culture, inspiring films, television shows, and music."

What is the active component in garcinia cambogia extract and what is its potential effect on weight loss?,"The active component in garcinia cambogia extract is hydroxycitric acid (HCA). Its potential effect on weight loss is that it inhibits the enzyme ATP-citrate lyase, diverting carbohydrates from fat storage to stored energy as glycogen. This leads to increased glycogen levels, which send a signal to the brain that the body is ""full"", causing reduced appetite and food intake, ultimately resulting in weight loss.","The active component in Garcinia cambogia extract is Hydroxycitric acid (HCA), a naturally occurring compound that has been studied for its potential weight loss effects.

Hydroxycitric acid is thought to inhibit the production of citrate lyase, an enzyme responsible for converting carbohydrates into glucose. By inhibiting this enzyme, HCA may reduce the amount of glucose produced in the body, which can lead to a decrease in calorie intake and ultimately result in weight loss.

Additionally, HCA may also have a direct effect on fat cells, causing them to release stored fat into the bloodstream, where it can be used as energy. This process is known as lipolysis.

The potential effects of HCA on weight loss include:

1. Reduced appetite: HCA may help reduce hunger and cravings, leading to a decrease in calorie intake.
2. Improved insulin sensitivity: By reducing glucose production, HCA may improve insulin sensitivity, which can help regulate blood sugar levels and promote weight loss.
3. Increased fat burning: HCA's lipolytic properties may increase the breakdown of stored"

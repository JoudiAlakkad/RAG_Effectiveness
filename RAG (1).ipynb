Angular motion: The server should generate angular motion by applying force to its spin or rotation axis. This angular motion helps to impart the necessary spin on the served ball.\\n\\n2. Rotational motion: In addition to generating angular motion, the server should also incorporate rotational motion into its serves. This rotational motion can be achieved through a combination of external and internal mechanical forces applied to the spin or rotation axis of the server.\\n\\nOverall, an ideal spin serve in table tennis involves a complex interplay between angular and rotational motion, as well as control over the speed and direction of the served ball.', 'context': 'The ideal spin serve will, if given the chance, bounce twice on the opponent\\'s side of the table, with the second bounce as close to the endline as possible.

A no-spin serve with a vigorous motion is called \"heavy no-spin.\" Seriously!\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe other reason a spinny serve might go long is the contact point is too high, which also leads to the serve being too high. Once you are grazing the ball very finely, you need to learn to serve it low with a low contact point, and learn where to bounce it on each side of the table for varying depths.

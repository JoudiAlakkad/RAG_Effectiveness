What is the ideal spin serve in table tennis?,"The ideal spin serve in table tennis involves a short and spinny serve with a low contact point. This serves has multiple benefits, including:

1. Shorter serve duration: A shorter serve duration allows for an easier grip on the ball during the serve motion. This helps maintain control of the serve while minimizing any potential risk or instability.

2. Higher spin rate: A short and spinny serve with a low contact point results in a higher spin rate. This is due to the increased distance between the player's hand and the ball during the serve motion. As a result, the served ball has a higher percentage of being flipped on its side than it would be had if the serve lasted longer.

Overall, an ideal spin serve in table tennis involves a short and spinny serve with a low contact point that results in a higher spin rate, as well as ensuring that the served ball has a high percentage of being flipped on its side than it would be had if the serve lasted longer.","The ideal spin serve in table tennis typically involves a full spin, which creates a large angle of attack on the opponent's racket. This spin serves a two-fold purpose: first, it creates an initial swing that can be further developed and executed to produce optimal results for the player.
Another factor that influences the ideal spin serve in table tennis is the individual player's strengths and weaknesses. For example, a player who is known for their high topspin may benefit from incorporating a full spin serve into their game plan to provide additional offensive power to the opponent.
In conclusion, the ideal spin serve in table tennis typically involves a full spin, which creates a large angle of attack on the opponent's racket. This spin serves a two-fold purpose: first, it creates an initial swing that can be further developed and executed to produce optimal results for the player. Another factor that influences the ideal spin serve in table tennis is the individual player's strengths and weaknesses. For example, a player who is known for their high topspin may benefit from incorporating a full spin serve into their game plan to provide additional offensive power to the opponent.","The ideal spin serve will, if given the chance, bounce twice on the opponent's side of the table, with the second bounce as close to the endline as possible. Sometimes a super-short serve is effective (which might bounce three or more times on the opponent's side, given the chance), as it forces the opponent to reach well over the table, but super-short serves are also easier to flip, push short, or quick-push at an angle. Many players use ""tweeny"" serves, where the second bounce is right around the endline, and the receiver is never quite sure if it will come off the end or not.

---

Once you have a true spin serve that you can serve short, that's when I'd recommend adding no-spin serves as a variation, and focusing on keeping this and the spin serves very low, with the second bounce near the endline. Serving no-spin when there's little threat of spin isn't as effective after the first few times. No-spin becomes far more effective when it can be done with a spin motion, when there's a threat of spin. (How do you serve no-spin with a spin motion? Several ways, but primarily by contacting the ball near the handle, where the racket travels slowly even in a vigorous serve.) A no-spin serve with a vigorous motion is called ""heavy no-spin."" Seriously!

---

Many players face a devastating choice: Should you serve with lots of spin, with the serve going long and allowing the opponent to loop, or should you sacrifice spin, even serving with no spin, so you can keep the serve short? Actually, you can do both. In fact, the spinnier the serve, the easier it is to keep short.

---

The other reason a spinny serve might go long is the contact point is too high, which also leads to the serve being too high. Once you are grazing the ball very finely, you need to learn to serve it low with a low contact point, and learn where to bounce it on each side of the table for varying depths. If you barely graze the ball, you'll not only maximize the spin but since nearly all your energy is going into spin, you'll find yourself almost struggling to get the ball to reach and go over the net - which is a good thing. It means the serve will be short and spinny.

---

It's easier to serve short backspin or no-spin than to serve short sidespin or topspin, or various combinations of these two. So many players fall into the habit of serving just backspin or no-spin when they want to serve short. This greatly limits their options, and makes things a lot easier for the opponent. Well-disguised backspin and no-spin serves are effective, but they are often even more effective if you can throw sidespin and topspin serves into the mix."

It isn’t at all uncommon for your roof to experience damage, but urn into a huge problem if it is left untreated. It can be just a minor leak, and it can create a lot of damage, especially to the interior of your home, such as ruined ceilings, wallboard and insulation. Therefore, it is very important that you take the time out of your day to regularly inspect your roof. This helps to detect minor issues long before they develop into major problems that require costly repairs. Here are 10 of the most frequent issues that you may come across with your roof:
Problem #1: The Sun.

---

Problem #1: The Sun.
Over time, the UV rays from the sun can result in the deterioration of your roof. This is particularly true if you have an asphalt singled roof. The asphalt shingles can dry, blister and crack, eventually coming loose and possibly falling off. If this happens, the sheathing underneath will be exposed – as will the roof – to the various weather elements.
Problem #2: Snow and Ice.

---

Problem #2: Snow and Ice.
Your roof can really take a beating from snow and ice. As the build-up of snow and ice melt, the water will make its way beneath the flashing and shingles where it will eventually refreeze. When it refreezes, it will lift the flashing and shingles, allowing for more water to seep through. The cycle can then start all over again. Eventually, the flashing and shingles can come loose or you can just have bad leaks on your hands. In either case, it is important to check your roof each spring if you live in an area where snow, ice and freezing are conditions you deal with regularly.
Problem #3: Strong Gusts of Wind.

---

Problem #10: Lack of Roof Maintenance.
If you fail to keep up with your roof maintenance, then you are going to have a host of problems. Most problems will start off small, such as the need to clean your clogged gutters or remove tree limbs that are hanging over your roof. However, when these issues are not corrected over a reasonable amount of time, they can result in significant roof damage. Therefore, regular inspections and routine maintenance can easily extend the lifespan of your home’s roof and also save you a considerable amount of money in the long run.
If you would like to schedule an inspection of your roof by a team of roofing professionals or need us to look at a problem that you found during your own inspection, give us a call at C and K Roofing.

---

Problem #4: Overhanging Tree Limbs.
Tree limbs that hang over your roof can rub against the surface of your roof causing the protective top layer of your shingles to be rubbed away. If branches were to fall onto your roof from a nearby tree, this can cause even more damage, such as puncturing a hole in your roof. So, on a regular basis, it is important to take the time to trim back tree limbs as much as possible away from your roof. If there is a roof that appears to pose a threat to the roof and your home as a whole, it is a good idea to have the entire thing removed as soon as possible.
Problem #5: Birds/Small Wildlife."

Welcome to our blog ""The Thread to Mylee""! Let me start by telling you a little bit about how we ventured into this journey called adoption. My name is Gina Farmer and my husband is Donnie. We have 3 biological children; Whitney (22), Dillon (14) and Peyton (11), and an adopted daughter from China, Maci (2).
We actually got the idea to adopt from China by attending a Steven Curtis Chapman concert. During the concert, God was really working on Donnies heart. During intermission he told me he was going to get some information on adopting from China. I was totally taken by surprise, but overwhelmed with joy!

---

But how could we afford this? We knew that if God had spoke to our hearts to adopt, He would take care of the financial end of it. Philippians 4:19 says ""And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus."" We adopted our beautiful daughter, Maci Marie JiaoLe Farmer on Christmas Day 2006! She has been such a blessing to our family and has brought us nothing but pure joy! We thank God for little Maci each and every day!
But God wasn't finished there! He spoke to me and Donnie yet again. So with great faith and little hesitation, we have started the paperwork to adopt another little girl from China. We will name her Mylee.

---

Debbie Wankel, a very special friend, called me one day and asked if I had thought about starting a blog to raise money for our adoption. She offered to help make hair bows and hand-made cards to sell. She even used her own money to get it started. Debbie and her husband are in the process of adopting a little girl from Ethiopia.
Our prayer is to raise above and beyond what we need to adopt little Mylee. We will then use the money we have raised to start a fund to help other families adopt internationally. Many families can afford the day to day expenses of raising a child, but cannot afford the inital cost of adoption. We want to help those families experience the same love and joy we have had by welcoming a beautiful child into their family. God bless!

---

Even before my husband and I got married we knew that we wanted to adopt. We got married in 1995. We were busy enjoying our life together and were in no rush to start a family. When we did decide to start a family, we thought that we would start our family the “easy way” first. We soon discovered that I could not get pregnant.
Looking back, I feel like the desire that both of us shared to adopt was God’s way of leading us to his ultimate gift of our JJ (John Junior).
Our journey

Our journey
Initially, we looked into foster care with hopes of adopting locally. It became clear quickly that foster care was not a good fit for us. Although we were understood that adoption is a slow process, we are not willing to take on the uncertainty that foster care to adoption presented. After much prayer and research, we choose to adoption internationally."
What is the consequence of a DUI in terms of car insurance according to Nevada laws?,"According to Nevada law, a driver who has been convicted of driving while intoxicated (DUI) may be required to purchase liability insurance (Liutnurance). 

When a driver is convicted of DUI, they are considered a high-risk driver due to the potential for accidents and injuries. In addition, a driver who has been convicted of DUI may also face financial consequences as they are required to pay higher premiums than drivers who do not have a prior conviction.

To illustrate how a driver's conviction for DUI can affect their car insurance in Nevada, let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: A driver who has been convicted of DUI drives their vehicle regularly and without any incidents. In this scenario, the driver would not need to purchase Liutnurance because they have not been convicted of DUI.

Scenario 2: A driver who has been convicted of DUI starts driving their vehicle less frequently than before, as a result of the driver's conviction for DUI. In this scenario, the driver would need to purchase Liutnurance because they have started driving their vehicle less frequently than before, as a result of the driver's conviction for DUI.

In conclusion, a driver who has been convicted of DUI may be required to purchase liability insurance (Liutnurance) in Nevada due to the potential consequences of their criminal record.","According to Nevada laws, if you have been convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) and are currently licensed to operate a vehicle in Nevada, your car insurance provider may raise rates or deny coverage due to your past criminal history.
To mitigate this risk, it is recommended that you inform your car insurance provider about your previous DUI conviction and your current driver's license status in Nevada. Your car insurance provider may then be able to adjust the appropriate rates or denials of coverage based on your past criminal history and your current driver's license status in Nevada.","Is not yet disclosed, but which has been having some cover for prized possessions exposed by losses caused by actions nevada car insurance laws Type of california affordable auto insurance quotes You can also freeze your account, you're confirming that you have with me Ensure that everything is current A high-risk or who lose their money.The event of accidental death and dismemberment (ad&d), and business needs To hurt a few of the burden of impending cancellations Reputable insurance companies and insurance processing in house A half times as a necessity nevada car insurance laws.

We dined on lobster rolls and clam chowder outdoors at Lobster Shanty on Artists Row, two doors down from an African drum shop. Then we walked to the Salem Witch Memorial, a solemn stone tribute to the 1692 trials that left 20 dead.

We dined at Rockafellas, in a former bank, on crab fritters, more clam chowder, and pear salad, then descended on the Peabody Essex Museum, which the New York Times dubbed “a cross-cultural marvel,” with its maritime collection and the world’s largest assemblage of Asian export art. Equally impressive is the town’s architecture, with post-medieval, Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival and Italianate homes. (The circa-1808 Morning Glory Bed and Breakfast is gorgeous and centrally located.)

Travel: Salem by Moonlight
At some point, “family vacation” becomes an oxymoron: Where do you go with teenagers? Ours acquiesced to Salem, Massachusetts, a town once gripped by hysterical youths diming out their elders. Sounds like fun!
We brought along the hound from hell, but the receptionist at the pet-friendly Salem Inn, an elegant conjunction of three Colonial townhomes, didn’t even glance at our 120-pound mutt as she handed me the key to our suite. It had exposed beams, a kitchenette, a Jacuzzi, a pullout couch and a daybed for the kids, a queen-size for us, and a petite balcony overlooking rooftops the kids recognized from the movie Hocus Pocus. They were downright tingly.

In summary, the controls for the Stellar Interface game include key input controls, environmental controls, navigation controls, and a heat map display to show the temperature of different locations in the game world.","Stellar Interface is an Indie game that I have had the pleasure of playing through Steam on the PC. Each time you play the game you are placed into different runs through the game and once you are killed the run ends. Each stage within a run puts your ship back to full health so that you are able to go into the next level refreshed. Each stage gives the player three different possibilities of what the level could involve, broken down by a percentage, the closer a percentage is to 100 the more likely the level will involve one. The fourth variable that is presented is the level of difficulty which is rated from 1 to 5, 5 being the most difficult. Each run is different as the levels are procedurally generated so that the experience of a run is always different.

---

The game uses simple controls which don’t take up any real concentration, which is very helpful when you work up to threat levels 3+, as the difficulty for each level does increase quite dramatically. The arrow keys move the ship, x is fire, c is dash, z lets you cycle between available consumables and space activates the chosen consumable. My only irritation with the controls is you can use any combination of movement, such as right and down to move in a diagonal line, apart from backwards. Which when you are in an awkward situation with all sorts of enemies, would have been quite useful. Before you begin a run, the player can choose between ships that they have unlocked, some will tell you what is most effective weaponry to be used as you can choose from a number of different weapons

---

So, before even launching, I feel like I learned a lot about how my ideal rules for the game actually might work out in practice. There are a lot of possible fixes. I think the one that appeals most to me is to have the game function more like “The World vs. Gabe” by finding a way to sum across all the other player accounts when rendering the leaderboard.

Indie games were observed and played. The Indie MegaBooth took a large amount of floor space this year and there were some great games. Some of the better games I played included Galax-Z from 17-Bit which is coming out for PS4 and Vita. I played this at PAX Prime last year and I really like the game mechanics, as well as the story. I would describe it as a fast paced asteroids-like Shump. At PAX East, the game looks and plays a lot a like I remembered, but the missions are now rogue-like, which means everytime you play a mission, they are randomly generated. The game looks and plays great. If gamers are interested in more information, here is a link."
What are some steps the NCUA has taken to encourage federally chartered credit unions?,"The National Credit Union Administration (NCUFA) has taken several steps to encourage federal chartered credit unions (CFUs):

1. Reforming TDRs: The NCUFA has sought to reform temporary restriction of payments (TDRPs)) for CFUs. In July 2015, the NCUFA approved a TDRP extension request for a CFU that was experiencing difficulties in complying with TDRPs due to increased operating expenses and reduced cash flow.

2. Providing Financial Support: The NCUFA has also sought to provide financial support to CFUs experiencing difficulties in complying with TDRPs due to increased operating expenses and reduced cash flow. In July 2015, the NCUFA approved a financial assistance grant extension request for a CFU that was experiencing difficulties in complying with TDRPs due to increased operating expenses and reduced cash flow.

3. Monitoring Credit Union Performance: The NCUFA has also sought to monitor credit union performance in accordance with regulatory requirements and industry best practices. In July 2015, the NCUFA approved a monitoring program extension request for a credit union that was experiencing difficulties in complying with TDRPs due to increased operating expenses and reduced cash flow.

4. Strengthening Credit Union Capabilities: The NCUFA has also sought to strengthen credit union capabilities in accordance with regulatory requirements and industry best practices. In July 2015, the NCUFA approved a strengthening program extension request for a credit union that was experiencing difficulties in complying with TDRPs due to increased operating expenses and reduced cash flow.

These steps taken by the NCUFA demonstrate its commitment to ensuring the stability of federal chartered credit unions and their members. This includes providing financial support, monitoring credit union performance, and strengthening credit union capabilities. By taking these steps, the NCUFA demonstrates its dedication to ensuring the stability of federal chartered credit unions and their members.","The National Credit Union Administration (NCUFA) has implemented several steps to encourage federally chartered credit unions (FCUs):

1. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFFA): The NCUA amended the RFFA in 2017, allowing FCUs to reduce certain regulatory burdens, such as those related to capital adequacy and loan disclosure.

2. Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA): In 2014, the NCUA adopted TILA amendments that require FCUs to disclose credit terms and fees to consumers more transparently than under traditional TILA laws.

3. Small Business and Entrepreneurship Support Act (SBESA): The NCUA amended SBESA in 2015, allowing FCUs to provide small business loans with competitive rates, lower fees, and better loan terms, thus encouraging economic growth within underserved communities.

These regulatory reforms have provided new opportunities for FCUs to expand their operations, increase the number of services offered to consumers, and promote economic growth within underserved communities.","Moody’s: Gov’t sale of UCPB stake ‘credit positive’
The sale of the government’s majority stake in United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) will improve the lender’s capitalization and credit quality moving forward, debt watcher Moody’s Corp. said on Thursday.
“A successful privatization of UCPB will help the bank raise new equity capital to meet Basel III capital requirements, a credit positive. And, if a larger bank acquires UCPB, we expect that UCPB’s credit quality would benefit from the support of its new majority shareholder,” Moody’s said in a statement.

“Sometimes we get a favorable response from the bank” that’s servicing the mortgage, but but if Fannie or Freddie holds the morgage – as they do in a large proportion of cases – “they’ll say it’s out of our hands,” he said.

“In the bigger picture we need some really profound changes in order to make good on housing as a human right, but in the short and medium term, DeMarco and the FHFA are in the way of getting help for a lot of people who are in trouble,” Schussler said.

Corbin said at this stage CTN is looking at a number of telecommunications representation groups to form the new peak body. These include CTN, Tedicore - a telecommunications disability representation group, and the small business representation group SETEL.
""We're looking at those organisations to form the core of the new peak body,"" she said.
""We have to prepare a proposal for the Minister by the end of July, so that's what this funding is going towards. We have to get our consumer groups and all our constituencies to support that proposal so that it's not just something that is imposed from above but something that has really come from the community. So there's consultation in all directions.""
Corbin said CTN will discover whether Conroy supports the proposal over the next 6 weeks.

Occupy groups have protested at the Republican and Democratic conventions, seeking to divert attention from the “horserace” to “the issues that matter to people,” said David Orlikoff of Occupy Chicago.
He points out that while the FBI estimates that financial institutions committed fraud in a large proportion of subprime loans, financial fraud prosecutions have dropped steadily under the Obama administration and are now at a 20-year low.

“Although no details have been released by either the government or the bank, we expect the terms of the recapitalization plan by first-quarter 2018, shortly after the government and the bank restart the planning work that was done during the last privatization attempt,” Moddy’s said.
“Mr. Dominguez said that the recapitalization program for UCPB should be pursued quickly because the government does not intend to extend the financial assistance for the bank beyond the expiration of the rehabilitation plan at the end of 2018,” it added.

What is the fundamental non-technical difference between Premiere Elements and Premiere Pro?,"The fundamental non-technical difference between Premiere Elements (Premiere Pro CC 2019)) and Premiere Pro (Premiere Pro CC 2018 or later) lies in their respective target audiences.

Premiere Elements is primarily designed for users who require a fast and user-friendly video editing software that supports multiple formats, including but not limited to AVI, MP4, MOV, FLV, VDF, etc. The software is also compatible with various third-party plugins, such as Adobe Creative Cloud Suite (CCS) version), which further enrich the functionality of the software.

On the other hand, Premiere Pro is specifically designed for professionals who require advanced video editing capabilities that not only support multiple formats but also allow for precise control over camera movements, composition, and color grading. The software is equipped with powerful features that enable users to perform advanced video editing tasks with ease, such as applying filters, adding effects, adjusting levels, exporting videos in various formats, etc.

Therefore, the fundamental non-technical difference between Premiere Elements and Premiere Pro lies in their respective target audiences, which differ in terms of their advanced video editing capabilities, precise control over camera movements, composition, and color grading, compatibility with third-party plugins, ease-of-use for advanced video editing tasks, etc.","The fundamental non-technical difference between Premiere Elements and Premiere Pro lies in their primary focus and functionality.

It is always a good idea to evaluate the free 30 day tryout of Premiere Elements 13 from Adobe before purchase to assure the compatibility of it with your computer environment and your project goals.
What is your computer operating system? Be advised that Premiere Elements 13 no longer supports Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Mac OSX 10.7.
There are no more .flv/.f4v exports. No more DV and HDV capture.

I was going to go Pro, but I checked your links. It's looking like Pro would be way over my head as a novice. I'm now inclined (but still waiting for others to weight in) to go with Elements. One thing that helped tip the scales (although someone may say that it's irrelevant) is that the videos for Elements seem to compose a detailed course. whereas the videos for Pro seem to be excerpts (serving as ads?) for other sites.

I had Photoshop Elements 6 and I had no problem sending slideshows to Premiere Elements 4.
Before I upgraded to Photoshop Elements 10, I was told (by Adobe LiveChat) that I could do the same thing from Photoshop Elements 10... and send my slideshows to Premiere Elements 4.
Was I mislead?
Yep. Sorry.
Premiere Elements 4 and Photo Elements 6 are a set. They talk to each other. (After Premiere Elements 4, Adobe made Premiere Elements and Photo Elements releases the same version number to avoid confusion.) Using the Organizer in Photo Elements 4, you can send your slideshow to Premiere Elements 4. (Technically, your slideshow is coming from the Organizer, not Photo Elements.)

---

Open the Organizer from Premiere Elements 10. This is the version 10 Organizer. It WILL port your slideshow to Premiere Elements 10 if you select the Send to Premiere Elements option. (Though do make sure your photos are no larger than 1000x750 pixels.)
I don’t HAVE Premiere Elements 10.
I have Premiere Elements 4 .
When I dealt with Live Chat that is why I enquired about compatibility with Premiere Elements 4.
If I had been told that Photoshop Element 10 (with Organizer) was NOT compatible with Premiere Elements 4; I would not have bought, it and instead would have considered purchasing the ‘bundled’ Photoshop Elements 10/Premiere Elements 10 combination…. But I was told the opposite so (in order to save some money) I purchased the stand-alone Photoshop 10."
What are the benefits of L Glutamine as described in the product description of Lactonovasport Glucogold?,"L Glutamine is an essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in building and maintaining muscle mass. Here are some benefits of L Glutamine as described in the product description:

1. Nutritional adequacy: L Glutamine is an essential amino acid, which means it cannot be produced by the body on its own. Therefore, when the body needs to build muscle mass, it will not have enough L Glutamine available to the body for protein synthesis.

2. Improved muscle function and recovery: L Glutamine plays a crucial role in building and maintaining muscle mass. When the body builds muscle mass through protein synthesis, it also requires nutrients such as L Glutamine to support muscle function and recovery.

3. Reduced risk of injury during exercise: L Glutamine is an essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in building and maintaining muscle mass. As mentioned above, when the body builds muscle mass through protein synthesis, it also requires nutrients such as L Glutamine to support muscle function and recovery.

During exercise, the muscles are subjected to stress due to increased metabolic rate and muscle contraction. To maintain muscle strength during exercise, the body needs to replenish its supply of essential amino acids, including L Glutamine, to support muscle protein synthesis.

Conclusively, L Glutamine is an essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in building and maintaining muscle mass. When the body builds muscle mass through protein synthesis, it also requires nutrients such as L Glutamine to support muscle function and recovery during exercise.","1. Improved Recovery: L Glutamine, when taken before exercise or post-workout, can improve muscle recovery by increasing the production of glutamine, a amino acid that plays a crucial role in muscle protein synthesis and protein degradation.

2. Enhanced Muscle Strength: L Glutamine can also enhance muscle strength by increasing muscle mass by promoting growth factors like IGF-1 and IGF-3, which are responsible for muscle growth.

3. Improved Mental Performance: L Glutamine can improve mental performance by increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, including the strengthening of connections between neurons.

4. Reduced Risk of Chronic Disease: L Glutamine can also reduce the risk of chronic diseases by promoting healthy gut microbiota, which is essential for maintaining good health and preventing various chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and heart disease.

In summary, L Glutamine has numerous benefits that make it an effective supplement for improving muscle recovery, enhancing mental performance, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and promoting healthy gut microbiota.","- Product Code : ls gg

Who is the head coach of Scio High's football team and what is his record?,"The head coach of Scio High's football team is Jim Mask, who has been with the school since 2018.
Mask has a record of 53-7 in his tenure as head coach. This includes a 6-0 start last fall and being poised for another deep playoff run before several injuries crippled its chances.
In conclusion, Jim Mask is the head coach of Scio High's football team and he has a record of 53-7 during his tenure.","The head coach of Scio High's football team is John Smith.
Smith has a record of 8-3 during his tenure as head coach. This record includes victories over rival schools, as well as wins against local teams. Overall, Smith's success at Scio High's football team has been recognized with numerous awards and accolades throughout his career as head coach.","SCIO — By tapping into the program’s traditional identity, Kyle Braa has transformed Scio High into a perennial football contender.
Braa, in his eighth season as head coach, is 78-16 overall with six league championships (two Tri-River Conference, four PacWest Conference) and a pair of 2A state titles. A prolific rushing attack coupled with a physical defense were the hallmarks of each team.
The formula hasn’t changed in 2017 as the top-seeded Loggers (9-1) prepare for Saturday’s matchup with No. 4 Cascade Christian (10-1) at Cottage Grove High in the 3A state semifinals. Kickoff is scheduled for noon with the winner advancing to meet No. 11 Rainier (9-2) or No. 2 Santiam Christian (9-2) in next week’s finals.

---

“It’s about all of my coaches,” said Braa, a 2001 Scio graduate who went on to play at Western Oregon. “We are all on the same page, we have the same vision and we know how we want to do things. It’s kind of a brotherhood here and we just understand the vision of Scio sports.”
The majority of Braa’s staff is comprised of fellow Scio alumni.
Assistant coaches Casey Childress and Jon Rounsavell graduated with Braa in 2001 while Matt Parazoo (class of 1994), Sam Gray (1997), Mike Ferguson (1999), Justin Guest (2011) and Harley Stephenson (2013) also attended Scio. Chad Peck and Will Baldwin have become adopted Loggers.

---

“I look forward to continuing the high standards and quality leadership set forth by Dr. Grover,” Franklin said. “Our emphasis in the school has always been on engaging and close interaction between our faculty and our students, and we also closely integrate our faith in the classroom.”
As Franklin moves back to the science building, he will leave the virtual campus in capable hands. Dr. Trifilo has been with the VC full time since 2012, serving as the Distance Learning Specialist. Trifilo holds a doctorate in education from Capella University and a master’s degree in science from St. Louis University. She earned her bachelor’s degree at the University of Iowa. Trifilo came to Wayland after working as the director of online learning at Hardin-Simmons University.

---

Braa’s initial stint as head coach lasted from 2007-10. The Loggers went 14-9 during his first two years before rattling off consecutive 14-0 records en route to the 2009 and 2010 2A state titles.
After walking away to focus on family and graduate school, Braa returned to the helm prior to the 2014 season. Jim Mask, Scio’s current athletic director, went 28-8 in Braa’s stead.
“My wife had our first kid, I had to go back and get my master’s and I was still the AD at the time. It just seemed really overwhelming trying to do all that,” Braa said of his decision to stop coaching. “So I stepped back, got my master’s done, my kid grew up a little bit and my wife was OK with me getting back into the deal.”

---

The Loggers have never missed the postseason under Braa, qualifying for six quarterfinals, five semifinals and two title games.
Braa credits the community’s youth programs for the varsity team’s consistency.
“We’ve had really good middle school coaching that’s helped with the fundamentals,” Braa said. “When kids come up to the high school level, I wouldn’t say that they’re ready for varsity football by any stretch, but they’ve got a good foundation, and that’s helped us a lot.”
Scio got off to a 6-0 start last fall and was poised for another deep playoff run before several injuries crippled its chances. The Loggers limped into the round of 16 and were routed by Cascade Christian, 49-0, to end the season."

Final Thoughts
Pier Solar and the Great Architects is a good RPG that has a very fun battle system but a harder than usual dungeon exploration setting due to its level design and some cryptic progression choices. The ability to switch from 16-bits to HD modes for both the soundtrack and the graphics is a very nice feature that will definitely please RPG gamers.
Also, do keep in mind that this game is Cross-Buy between the PS3 and PS4 versions, and that a Vita version is coming soon!

Game engine and soundtrack
One of the strengths of Pier Solar and the Great Architects is how well the visual and game engines are done. The soundtrack is pretty good, and can be switched from 16-bits or remastered on-the-fly (I preferred the charm of the remastered one though!). Same goes for the rendering modes, which can be switched from 16-bit to HD and HD+. I preferred the HD modes, but like I mentioned earlier, the level design has a lot of hidden paths that appeared almost invisible on the HD mode. Because of this, I often needed to switch to 16-bits rendering in order to see the paths and get through a dungeon, and then back to HD once I found the way.

Camera houses typically host photography competitions or awards programs where participants showcase their skills and creativity using a variety of cameras.

Without further context, it is impossible to determine the specific camera that the author won from Camera House.","The center point focus also seemed like the focus point was fine enough to pick up fine objects as the desired point of focus. I did however note that being used to my sony nex’s that it would greatly benefit from a tilt screen, however at around $100 retail. This camera is still quite a steal.

The zoom does seem quite adequate and is rather quick to zoom to the longer end. It doesn’t seem to lose too much sharpness at the long end either. I was able to snap this shot sitting in a cafe quite a way away from this couple with a dog. The 25-200mm zoom is quite handy and rather good for a camera in this class.

Despite these minor defects it’s a very sharp lens overall, especially in the center of the field. Frankly, any older 35mm f/2 Summicron will take beautiful pictures, but bokeh fanatics should look for the Type 4 with serial numbers in the 2,974,000-3,731.000 range.

Built-in and external flash
The two cameras have in-built flashes, which makes them very great at taking pictures in low light conditions. They are also compatible with external flashes, which is usually preferred if better control of light is desired. They allow capturing of very great shots even at night.
Autofocus tracking
This was a cool feature in the Canon 70D and made its way to the Canon 7D Mark II as well. It allows you to track any movement. Combined with continuous autofocus in both, the features make the two cameras an excellent choice for focusing on moving objects. You are likely to see these cameras with sports photographers.

Price range: In Contax rangefinder mount: $125-350
6. 80mm f/2.8 Mamiya-Sekor
This is the two-lens interchangeable standard lens unit for Mamiya twin-lens reflex cameras and it’s a real sleeper, delivering impressive image quality even at f/2.8 (except in the extreme corners of the field), outstanding sharpness, good contrast, and beautiful bokeh throughout its extended focusing range, especially when used for portraiture.
A 5-element 3-group design similar to Leica’s 90mm f/2.8 Elmarit provides excellent chromatic aberration correction and high resolution, but tends to flare in backlit situations—the last “blue dot” multicoated versions are less prone to flare and ghosting. If you’re tempted, go whole hog and get a Mamiya C330 camera complete with this lens for about $250-300."

Another great game was Aztez from Team Colorblind. I also played this at Prime last year. This a brutal, 2D action game. It’s in black and white with lots of blood, as gamers take on waves of enemies with combo attacks. This looks like a great game to keep an eye on.
Secret Ponchos by Switchblade Monkeys was another Indie game I had played before at Prime and I was eager to see it again. It is coming out to PS4 and it is a team-based, arena western game. They have added a new character that is focused on close combat. I prefer Phantom Poncho, who uses a shotgun. The game is fast paced and looks be in early access this summer.

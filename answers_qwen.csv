What is the ideal spin serve in table tennis?,"The ideal spin serve in table tennis refers to a serve that utilizes a high level of spin to keep the ball short and easy to return or hit on its opponent's side of the table. This serve requires a delicate balance between the spin generated from the serve and the ability of the ball to reach and go over the net, which is essential for success in table tennis.

This serve requires a delicate balance between the spin generated from the serve and the ability of the ball to reach and go over the net, which is essential for success in table tennis.","The ideal spin serve in table tennis involves a combination of angular and rotational motion, as well as control over the speed and direction of the served ball.

Here are some key elements to consider when designing an ideal spin serve:

1. Angular motion: The server should generate angular motion by applying force to its spin or rotation axis. This angular motion helps to impart the necessary spin on the served ball.

2. Rotational motion: In addition to generating angular motion, the server should also incorporate rotational motion into its serves. This rotational motion can be achieved through a combination of external and internal mechanical forces applied to the spin or rotation axis of the server.

Overall, an ideal spin serve in table tennis involves a complex interplay between angular and rotational motion, as well as control over the speed and direction of the served ball.","The ideal spin serve will, if given the chance, bounce twice on the opponent's side of the table, with the second bounce as close to the endline as possible. Sometimes a super-short serve is effective (which might bounce three or more times on the opponent's side, given the chance), as it forces the opponent to reach well over the table, but super-short serves are also easier to flip, push short, or quick-push at an angle. Many players use ""tweeny"" serves, where the second bounce is right around the

---

Many players face a devastating choice: Should you serve with lots of spin, with the serve going long and allowing the opponent to loop, or should you sacrifice spin, even serving with no spin, so you can keep the serve short? Actually, you can do both. In fact, the spinnier the serve, the easier it is to keep short.

---

ways, but primarily by contacting the ball near the handle, where the racket travels slowly even in a vigorous serve.) A no-spin serve with a vigorous motion is called ""heavy no-spin."" Seriously!

---

The other reason a spinny serve might go long is the contact point is too high, which also leads to the serve being too high. Once you are grazing the ball very finely, you need to learn to serve it low with a low contact point, and learn where to bounce it on each side of the table for varying depths. If you barely graze the ball, you'll not only maximize the spin but since nearly all your energy is going into spin, you'll find yourself almost struggling to get the ball to reach and go over the net -

---

all of the energy from your arm and wrist goes into spin. When that happens, the ball barely comes off the racket - and so it is easy to keep the ball short. Those who have difficulty serving short with spin are having trouble mostly because they are not grazing the ball finely enough - and so the solution isn't to serve with less spin; it's to serve with more spin by grazing the ball more."

What are some common problems that can damage a roof?,"Some common problems that can damage a roof include:

1. Sun Damage: As mentioned earlier, UV rays from the sun can cause the shingles and flashing to dry out, blister, and crack, eventually coming loose and possibly falling off.

2. Snow Damage: During the winter months, snow can melt at a fast pace and the water will refreeze, causing ice dams to form. This repeated process can damage the roof’s shingles, flashing, and other vulnerable components over time.

3. Wildlife Damage: Certain types of wildlife such as squirrels, chipmunks, birds like parrots, doves, etc., can cause damage to a roof's shingles, flashing, and other vulnerable components over time. This is particularly true for roofs that have sloping edges or valleys, which can allow small animals such as raccoons, possums, etc., to climb up the roof and cause damage to the shingles, flashing, and other vulnerable components over time.

4. Water Damage: If water from a leaky roof penetrates into your home, it can cause extensive damage to various parts of your home, including flooring, drywall, insulation, cabinets, countertops, walls, skylights, and others. This is particularly true for roofs that have significant gaps or valleys between the rafters, as well as roofs that have undergone major structural modifications or repairs, such as roof replacements with new materials or technologies, roof waterproofing systems, etc.

In summary, some common problems that can damage a roof include sun damage, snow damage, wildlife damage, water damage, and others. It is important to regularly inspect your roof for signs of damage and take appropriate action to prevent further damage or minimize the impact of any existing damage on your home's structure and functionality.","1. Wear and tear: Over time, the materials used to make a roof can wear down and become compromised. This can lead to leaks, condensation, and other issues.

2. Accidents or natural disasters: Roofers working on commercial or industrial roofs are more likely to be involved in accidents or natural disasters that damage roofs. For example, hurricanes can cause significant damage to roof structures, leading to leaks, condensation, and other issues.

3. Incorrect installation: Roofing professionals who install roofs using incorrect methods or techniques can cause significant damage to roof structures. For example, installing a single-ply roof instead of a double-ply roof can lead to leaks and other issues due to the difference in slope between the two types of roofs.","10 of the Most Common Problems You May Encounter with Your Roof

Here are 10 of the most frequent issues that you may come across with your roof:

---

It isn’t at all uncommon for your roof to experience damage, but urn into a huge problem if it is left untreated. It can be just a minor leak, and it can create a lot of damage, especially to the interior of your home, such as ruined ceilings, wallboard and insulation. Therefore, it is very important that you take the time out of your day to regularly inspect your roof. This helps to detect minor issues long before they develop into major problems that require costly repairs. Here are 10 of the most

---

Problem #1: The Sun.
Over time, the UV rays from the sun can result in the deterioration of your roof. This is particularly true if you have an asphalt singled roof. The asphalt shingles can dry, blister and crack, eventually coming loose and possibly falling off. If this happens, the sheathing underneath will be exposed – as will the roof – to the various weather elements.
Problem #2: Snow and Ice.

---

Problem #9: Poorly Ventilated Attic.
Your roof’s lifespan can quickly be shortened if your attic is not insulated properly. When your attic gets too hot over the summer months, the roof’s shingles “bake” from underneath. This causes them to dry out and become brittle. If the attic is too hot during the winter months, then the snow will melt at a fast pace and the water will refreeze. This continues repeatedly and causes the shingles and flashing to lift continuously.
Problem #10: Lack of Roof Maintenance."

IBM denied Cuff's allegations, stating that it had taken reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of Cuff's medical records, and that such steps were consistent with its industry standards and practices for data management and security.
Cuff's lawsuit against IBM was a significant legal event in the history of information technology. The case highlighted the importance of ensuring the accuracy and integrity of medical records, particularly in industries such as healthcare where medical knowledge is highly valued. The case also laid the foundation for ongoing discussions and initiatives aimed at improving data management and security practices in the context of information technology.",", 1994

Who inspired the Farmer family to consider adoption from China?,"God's way of leading the Farmer family to consider adoption from China can be traced back to the Steven Curtis Chapman concert they attended. During the concert, God was said to have spoken to the Farmer family and Donnie about their desire to adopt from China. This revelation led the Farmer family to consider adoption from China as a way to fulfill their own spiritual desires and to receive God's ultimate gift of their JJ  (John Junior).","The inspiration for the Farmer family to consider adoption from China is likely based on a variety of factors, including personal experiences, cultural beliefs, economic considerations, and the availability of Chinese child welfare services.

For example, the farmer may have grown up in a rural area of the United States or Canada, where adoption from China may be seen as an opportunity for a new life in a different country.

Similarly, the farmer may have been raised in a traditional Chinese culture that values family, community, and social harmony. Adoption from China may be seen as an opportunity to experience and understand these cultural values in a different context.

Finally, the availability of Chinese child welfare services is likely to play a role in the farmer's decision to consider adoption from China. These child welfare services may provide the farmer with access to language interpretation, legal representation, social support, education resources, and other forms of support that can be invaluable for an individual who is considering adoption from China.

In conclusion, the inspiration for the Farmer family to consider adoption from China is likely based on a variety of factors, including personal experiences, cultural beliefs, economic considerations, and the availability of Chinese child welfare services.","THE FARMER FAMILY

Welcome to our blog ""The Thread to Mylee""! Let me start by telling you a little bit about how we ventured into this journey called adoption. My name is Gina Farmer and my husband is Donnie. We have 3 biological children; Whitney (22), Dillon (14) and Peyton (11), and an adopted daughter from China, Maci (2).

---

But how could we afford this? We knew that if God had spoke to our hearts to adopt, He would take care of the financial end of it. Philippians 4:19 says ""And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus."" We adopted our beautiful daughter, Maci Marie JiaoLe Farmer on Christmas Day 2006! She has been such a blessing to our family and has brought us nothing but pure joy! We thank God for little Maci each and every day!

---

We actually got the idea to adopt from China by attending a Steven Curtis Chapman concert. During the concert, God was really working on Donnies heart. During intermission he told me he was going to get some information on adopting from China. I was totally taken by surprise, but overwhelmed with joy!

---

But God wasn't finished there! He spoke to me and Donnie yet again. So with great faith and little hesitation, we have started the paperwork to adopt another little girl from China. We will name her Mylee.

---

Even before my husband and I got married we knew that we wanted to adopt. We got married in 1995. We were busy enjoying our life together and were in no rush to start a family. When we did decide to start a family, we thought that we would start our family the “easy way” first. We soon discovered that I could not get pregnant.
Looking back, I feel like the desire that both of us shared to adopt was God’s way of leading us to his ultimate gift of our JJ (John Junior).

Watch him in my face and lick me laughing about his little cock and call him a loser while I tell him what to do with my black bull cum out of my pussy. This will not be easier . Watching as I clamp washclothes against my breasts and pussy, groaned against a ball ball and fumbled around while blindfolded before I took my vibrator and led me to a quick orgasm. I'm just a person, but it's such a great recipe, it has to be done from time to time.

Controls
The biggest issue with playing Fallout 4 VR on WMR is undoubtedly the controls. While WMR motion controllers are sort of a mix between Oculus Touch and the Vive wands, the touchpads just aren't quite the same.

Other than the movement speed issue that can be mostly fixed and the occasional direction changes, controls are on an even playing field with the Vive. All buttons from the Vive's setup have an intuitive spot on the WMR motion controllers, and the angle at which you hold the controller to aim down the sight of your gun feels just as natural.

I don’t know who designed such a forceful effects then only change to square mode. Just ok fancy app. Better than stupid iMovie app which is good for nothing complex confusing app in which one cant even no where file is what happening to it where is that going.

Because smooth movement — the type that's best suited for immersion — requires constant contact with the touchpad, you'll quickly notice how it's not as responsive on WMR as it is on Vive. It seems like it will occasionally send you off in a direction you didn't want to go, and you'll have to remove your thumb and let if figure itself not. This could have to do with moisture on the hands during long periods of play."

I was going to go Pro, but I checked your links. It's looking like Pro would be way over my head as a novice. I'm now inclined (but still waiting for others to weight in) to go with Elements. One thing that helped tip the scales (although someone may say that it's irrelevant) is that the videos for Elements seem to compose a detailed course. whereas the videos for Pro seem to be excerpts (serving as ads?) for other sites.

What are the benefits of L Glutamine as described in the product description of Lactonovasport Glucogold?,"L Glutamine is a widely recognized essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in muscle building, recovery, and overall health.

Some of the benefits of L Glutamine mentioned in the product description include:

1. Muscle Building: L Glutamine is an important component of protein synthesis pathways. It helps to build and maintain muscle mass by providing the necessary building blocks for muscle fibers, such as leucine (lysine), methionine (methionine)), which are then released into the bloodstream, where they can be used by the body's muscle cells to synthesize new proteins and grow muscle tissue.

2. Recovery: L Glutamine is also important for post-workout recovery. It helps to repair and rebuild muscle tissue after intense exercise or physical activity. This includes breaking down stored protein molecules in muscles, which are then reabsorbed into the bloodstream, where they can be used by the body's muscle cells to synthesize new proteins and grow muscle tissue.

3. Improved Workout: L Glutamine is also important for improved workout results. It helps to stimulate muscle growth and recovery during workouts, as it helps to provide the necessary building blocks for muscle fibers, such as leucine (lysine), methionine (methionine)), which are then released into the bloodstream, where they can be used by the body's muscle cells to synthesize new proteins and grow muscle tissue. This helps to improve workout results by providing the necessary building blocks for muscle fibers during workouts.

In conclusion, L Glutamine is a widely recognized essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in muscle building, recovery, and overall health. Its benefits include improved workout results by providing the necessary building blocks for muscle fibers during workouts.","L Glutamine is a dietary supplement that claims to provide several benefits, including:

1. Increased protein synthesis: L Glutamine contains L-glutamic acid, which is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of proteins.

Increased protein synthesis in the body leads to an increase in muscle mass, strength, and endurance. This can help individuals achieve their fitness goals faster and more efficiently.

2. Improved immune system function: L Glutamine also contains glutamine hydroxylase (GLDH), which is an enzyme that converts glutamine from dietary sources into glucose for energy production.

 improved immune system function in the body helps protect against infections, diseases, and other health issues. This can help individuals maintain good health and prevent chronic illnesses or disabilities.

In conclusion, L Glutamine as described in the product description provides several benefits to the body, including increased protein synthesis, improved immune system function, and faster muscle mass, strength, and endurance gains. These benefits can help individuals achieve their fitness goals faster and more efficiently, leading to improved health outcomes, reduced risk of chronic illnesses or disabilities, and enhanced quality of life.","- Product Code : ls gg

His record for Scio High's football team during his tenure as head coach is 78-16, with four league championships (two Tri-River Conference, four PacWest Conference) and two state titles.
Braa has been coaching at Scio High School since 2007, when he returned to the helm prior to the 2014 season. Since then, Braa has led his team to multiple league championships, as well as two state titles.","The head coach of Scio High's football team is John Johnson. John Johnson has been coaching Scio High's football team since 2017.
Johnson's overall record as a head coach at Scio High's football team is 35-45. This means that Johnson has won 3 out of 4 seasons, which is not very impressive when you consider his overall record.","SCIO — By tapping into the program’s traditional identity, Kyle Braa has transformed Scio High into a perennial football contender.
Braa, in his eighth season as head coach, is 78-16 overall with six league championships (two Tri-River Conference, four PacWest Conference) and a pair of 2A state titles. A prolific rushing attack coupled with a physical defense were the hallmarks of each team.

---

Braa’s initial stint as head coach lasted from 2007-10. The Loggers went 14-9 during his first two years before rattling off consecutive 14-0 records en route to the 2009 and 2010 2A state titles.
After walking away to focus on family and graduate school, Braa returned to the helm prior to the 2014 season. Jim Mask, Scio’s current athletic director, went 28-8 in Braa’s stead.

---

“It’s about all of my coaches,” said Braa, a 2001 Scio graduate who went on to play at Western Oregon. “We are all on the same page, we have the same vision and we know how we want to do things. It’s kind of a brotherhood here and we just understand the vision of Scio sports.”
The majority of Braa’s staff is comprised of fellow Scio alumni.

---

Assistant coaches Casey Childress and Jon Rounsavell graduated with Braa in 2001 while Matt Parazoo (class of 1994), Sam Gray (1997), Mike Ferguson (1999), Justin Guest (2011) and Harley Stephenson (2013) also attended Scio. Chad Peck and Will Baldwin have become adopted Loggers.

Scio got off to a 6-0 start last fall and was poised for another deep playoff run before several injuries crippled its chances. The Loggers limped into the round of 16 and were routed by Cascade Christian, 49-0, to end the season.
The Challengers ran through the battered Loggers while quarterback Haiden Schaan, a two-time Southern Cascade League offensive player of the year, was effective in the passing game."

Final Thoughts
Pier Solar and the Great Architects is a good RPG that has a very fun battle system but a harder than usual dungeon exploration setting due to its level design and some cryptic progression choices. The ability to switch from 16-bits to HD modes for both the soundtrack and the graphics is a very nice feature that will definitely please RPG gamers.
Also, do keep in mind that this game is Cross-Buy between the PS3 and PS4 versions, and that a Vita version is coming soon!

One of the strengths of Pier Solar and the Great Architects is how well the visual and game engines are done. The soundtrack is pretty good, and can be switched from 16-bits or remastered on-the-fly (I preferred the charm of the remastered one though!). Same goes for the rendering modes, which can be switched from 16-bit to HD and HD+. I preferred the HD modes, but like I mentioned earlier, the level design has a lot of hidden paths that appeared almost invisible on the HD mode. Because of this, I often"

What are some of the specifications of the camera that the author won from Camera House?,"The camera mentioned in the article has several specifications that set it apart from other cameras on the market.

1. Focal Length Range: The camera's focal length range is 70mm to 200mm, which means the camera can capture a wide range of objects and landscapes, from small flowers and insects to larger buildings and landscapes in the distance.

2. Minimum Focus Distance: The minimum focus distance of the camera is 4.6 feet (1.4 m)), which means that the camera is designed for use with compact cameras or point-and-shoot cameras that have a smaller maximum focal length range than traditional fixed-point lenses.

3. Internal Focus: One of the key specifications of the camera mentioned in the article is its internal focus, which is typically set to either 50mm or 105mm, depending on the specific design and characteristics of the camera being used.

This internal focus setting of the camera allows for precise control over the composition and perspective of the images taken with the camera. This internal focus setting of the camera can be particularly useful in low-light conditions where traditional fixed-point lenses may not provide sufficient optical resolution to capture properly the fine details and textures that make up the subjects being photographed.

In summary, the camera mentioned in the article has several specifications, including its focal length range, minimum focus distance, internal focus setting, among others. These specifications of the camera set it apart from other cameras on the market, making it an ideal choice for individuals looking to capture beautiful and high-quality images in various lighting conditions and settings.","Unfortunately, the question does not provide any specific information about the camera that the author won from Camera House. 

To answer this question accurately, we would need to know more about the camera that was being featured in the competition.

Here are some general specifications that a camera might have:

1. Aperture: This is the opening through which light enters the camera. The aperture can be controlled to adjust the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor.

2. Resolution: This is the smallest unit of information that can be represented by an image. The resolution of an image can vary depending on the specific camera being used.

3. Color Space: This refers to the range of colors that are represented in an image. There are several color spaces, including RGB (red, green, blue)), CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow), and HSV (hue, saturation, value). 

By knowing these general specifications, we can begin to understand the camera that the author won from Camera House.","- Focal Length Range : 70 -200 mm, Minimum Focus Distance- 4.6 ft.(1.4 m)

A 5-element 3-group design similar to Leica’s 90mm f/2.8 Elmarit provides excellent chromatic aberration correction and high resolution, but tends to flare in backlit situations—the last “blue dot” multicoated versions are less prone to flare and ghosting.

The center point focus also seemed like the focus point was fine enough to pick up fine objects as the desired point of focus. I did however note that being used to my sony nex’s that it would greatly benefit from a tilt screen, however at around $100 retail. This camera is still quite a steal.

Despite these minor defects it’s a very sharp lens overall, especially in the center of the field. Frankly, any older 35mm f/2 Summicron will take beautiful pictures, but bokeh fanatics should look for the Type 4 with serial numbers in the 2,974,000-3,731.000 range.

Built-in and external flash
The two cameras have in-built flashes, which makes them very great at taking pictures in low light conditions. They are also compatible with external flashes, which is usually preferred if better control of light is desired. They allow capturing of very great shots even at night.

The Last King of Scotland is an interesting character study and shows that sometimes the scariest villains are the one that seem harmless. Here is where Forest Whitaker, perennial movie nice guy, fits in perfectly. Whitaker always brings a sense of sereneness to his roles. In this film Whitaker adds a sense of unpredictability and danger to his usual machinations. Whitaker conveys such an excellent sense of charm and madness that you never really know what his character will do. Needless to say Whitaker is

“Wassup Rockers,” out Friday, follows the antics of Jonathan, Kico, Milton, Porky, Eddie, Louie and Carlos – young Latino skakeboarders from Los Angeles’ South Central ghetto (much like the firsttime actors who play them) who take a trip to posh Beverly Hills, where they’re hassled by cops and picked up by rich white girls. The movie is partially based on the real lives of its actors.
Some say “Wassup Rockers” is tamer and more sentimental than your other films."

2. High demand: In many regions, there is a high demand for residential apartments due to factors such as population growth, urbanization, and young professionals seeking affordable housing.

What was the major consequence of the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment?,"The major consequence of the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment was to damage its reputation and potentially harm other companies in the same industry.
The cyber-attack targeted various sensitive information held by Sony Pictures Entertainment, including personal data of employees, financial data, intellectual property, and customer relationship data. The attack used a variant of ransomware called WannaCry (2017) which was able to spread rapidly across multiple networks, including Sony Pictures Entertainment's own systems.
The cyber-attack also caused significant disruption in Sony Pictures Entertainment's operations and financial reporting, including the suspension of certain business activities, the loss of revenue from various sources, including customers, distributors, and contractors, the impairment of certain assets held by Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the disclosure of certain information related to its operations and financial performance, as well as any other events or developments that may have affected the company's reputation and financial performance during the period in question.
In addition to the reputational damage caused by the cyber-attack, Sony Pictures Entertainment faced significant financial losses due to the disruption in its operations and financial reporting caused by the cyber-attack. These losses included the suspension of certain business activities, the loss of revenue from various sources, including customers, distributors, and contractors, the impairment of certain assets held by Sony Pictures Entertainment, the costs associated with implementing new systems and processes in order to mitigate the impact of the cyber-attack on its operations and financial reporting, as well as any other events or developments that may have affected the company's reputation and financial performance during the period in question,
which has had a significant negative impact on Sony Pictures Entertainment's reputation, financial stability, and ability to operate effectively in today’s highly competitive business landscape.","The major consequence of the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment was a significant financial loss for the company. The attack, which involved stealing sensitive information such as scripts and employee databases, occurred in early December 2015.
As a result of the attack, Sony Pictures Entertainment had to pay a ransom to regain access to its systems and data. This ransom amount is estimated to be between $1 million and $3 million.
In addition to the financial loss, Sony Pictures Entertainment was also forced to take steps to prevent similar cyber-attacks in the future. This included implementing new security measures such as multi-factor authentication and encryption of sensitive information both at rest and in transit.
Overall, the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment had significant consequences for the company, including a significant financial loss and a need to implement new security measures to prevent similar attacks in the future.","The consequences for Sony have been swift and devastating since the public attack, exposing the media company to potential lawsuits and Hollywood backlash.
Perhaps the most damaging will harm Sony’s reputation, and the harsh reality that even the biggest corporate lines and computer systems are vulnerable to attack.

North Korea suspected in vicious cyber attacks
Let the hacking commence.
Last month’s crippling cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment revealed confidential information of business practices, employee pay disparities and personal data, unpublished scripts, sensitive contracts, and ugly personal feuds between actors and executives. Experts say these secrets could damage the Hollywood studio for years to come.

---

Although an unknown hacking group calling themselves the “Guardians of Peace” has taken partial credit for the major cyber-leak, the FBI is yet to determine the culprit,
Rather than focusing on traditional targets of cyber-intrusions, such as credit cards, those behind the attack chose to use sensitive information as a weapon of vengeance for Sony’s supposed misdeeds.

---

The hacking into one of Hollywood’s biggest studios has alarmed US officials and cyber security experts, who say this is the first major attack on a US company to use malicious software designed to “incapacitate” computer networks.
“This is a step beyond what they’ve done in the past, but it’s a logical trajectory for them,” said James Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

---

FBI officials and investigators are also determining whether the cyber-attack is linked to North Korea, a reclusive nation with an increasingly potent hacking capability. Sources say the hack may have occurred in retaliation for Sony’s upcoming Christmas release, The Interview, a comedy built around a fictional CIA plot to kill North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, who is revered in the nation. North Koreans have repeatedly denounced the film, warning of “stern” and “merciless” retaliation, but the"
What are some examples of expenditures that have been found to constitute community waste in a marriage?,"Expenditures that have been found to constitute community waste in a marriage include:

1. Gambling expenses - If one spouse indulges in gambling, it may amount to community property and be divided evenly.

2. Alcohol-related expenses - Expenditures incurred in alcohol-related activities, such as drinking at bars or hosting clients for partying, can also be found to constitute community waste in a marriage.

3. Other non-family property expenses - Expenditures incurred by one spouse that are not family property, such as renting out a home for a friend's visit or investing in an investment vehicle, can also be found to constitute community waste in a marriage.

4. Marriage-related property transfers - Transfers of marital property between spouses occur frequently and can amount to community property if they are not fairly divided between the parties. Such transfers may involve real estate transactions, bank deposits, investments in stocks or bonds, and other forms of property transfers.

5. Community property debts - Debts incurred by one spouse that belong to community property, such as mortgage payments or taxes paid on business income, can also be found to constitute community waste in a marriage, as long as the debts are not fairly divided between the parties.

In summary, some examples of expenditures that have been found to constitute community waste in a marriage include gambling expenses, alcohol-related expenses, other non-family property expenses, marriage-related property transfers, and community property debts.","There are several examples of expenditures that have been found to constitute community waste in a marriage. Here are a few:

1. Household Cleaning Products: Household cleaning products, such as toilet paper, washing detergent, and bleach, can contribute to community waste if they are not disposed of properly.

2. Food Waste: Food waste is another significant contributor to community waste in a marriage. Food scraps, such as vegetable peelings and fruit cores, can end up in landfills or be eaten by animals if they are not treated properly.

3. Personal Care Products: Personal care products, such as toothpaste, mouthwash, shaving cream, and deodorant, can contribute to community waste in a marriage if they are not disposed of properly.

In conclusion, household cleaning products, food waste, personal care products, and other types of non-renewable resources can be found to constitute community waste in a marriage. It is essential to dispose of these materials properly to avoid contributing to environmental pollution.","In an article published in the Journal of the Academy of Matrimonial Attorneys, the author observes that the following expenditures by one spouse, without the permission of the other spouse, have been found to constitute community waste: (1) gambling; (2) a failure to make mortgage or tax payments resulting in a foreclosure; (3) alcohol- and drug-related expenses; and (4) expenses incurred in furthering extramarital affairs.

---

The husband denied community waste and testified that some of the expenditures in question were from taking clients to lunch, business travel, buying a present for his wife and his wife's Lasik surgery. He produced evidence that at least some of the charges were business expenses and that several of the checks in question were written to-and cashed by-his wife.

---

Waste of community property may result in jointly owned community property not being divided evenly by an Arizona court upon a marital dissolution.

---

A good example of an Arizona case where waste was found is Gutierrez v. Gutierrez. There, the husband withdrew approximately $62,000 from the community retirement account without his wife's knowledge and was unable to explain how he had spent such a large sum of money. What was clear was that the expenditures were excessive, abnormal and did not benefit the community.
The Gazeley case

---

Since Arizona is a community property state, property acquired during a marriage is generally deemed to be jointly owned by both parties and, upon divorce, is to be divided evenly. Exceptions do exist. In dividing marital assets and debts, courts can give consideration to excessive or abnormal expenditures by one spouse that amount to squandering jointly held property. The squandering of assets by a spouse, which is referred to as waste, may mean that the spouse committing waste will be allocated less"

Casinos, on the other hand, typically refer to a structure or establishment that offers gaming activities and entertainment services. Casinos can operate in various types of locations, including land-based casinos located within cities or towns, as well as online casinos that operate via the internet.

1 tablespoon butter
1 cup finely diced red pepper
2 medium shallot, peeled and finely chopped

On the other hand, story-line based blogs feature a series of interconnected events, plot points, characters, settings, themes, motifs, symbolism, idioms, proverbs, sayings, expressions, colloquialisms, puns, wordplay, language, dialects, writing styles, genres, sub-genres, literary techniques, poetic devices, metaphors, similes, personification, symbolic representation, symbolic metaphor, symbolic analogy, symbolism in literature, etc. The blog posts also provide insights into the world of the story and how their actions and decisions affect others in the universe.

The first and probably the most common type, belongs to a specific character. The second type follows a particular story or plot. Both a character or a story line blog can have a single author or be a collection of works from a variety of authors. In some cases, each character might have a sub-blog with the master, top level, blog being the collected stories of all the characters (this is a great way to write a novel for NaNoWriMo, by the way).

Fictional blogs can be some of the most creative and extensive blogs you’ll ever see. They can also be very bare bones and text-heavy. It depends on the blogger and the platform.

---

Not all blogs are real.
That is, they don’t cover real events happening to real people in the real world. They are actual blogs. They’re just fictional. They cover the events in lives of fictional characters in imaginary worlds that can (but often don’t) resemble the real world.

"What is the common meaning of the phrase ""Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί"" as used in various instances in the Bible?","The phrase ""Τί ἐμοiefs καὶ σοί"" can be understood as a statement or question that Jesus poses to his mother, Mary, and to God's people, asking them about their response to others' offenses.

The common meaning of this phrase is a call to action, encouraging individuals and communities to treat others with respect, kindness, and empathy.

In various instances in the Bible, Jesus uses this phrase to ask questions about his actions and decisions as well as to seek guidance from his mother and from God's people.

For example, in John 12:14-15, Jesus uses this phrase to address his mother, Mary, and to emphasize the importance of treating others with respect and kindness, regardless of their background or circumstances.

In another instance, in Luke 8:37, Jesus uses this phrase to address his disciples, asking them to forgive those who have wronged them by treating them with love and compassion, rather than with anger, hatred, or malice.

Overall, the common meaning of the phrase ""Τί ἐμοiefs καὶ σοί"" used in various instances in the Bible is a call to action, encouraging individuals and communities to treat others with respect, kindness, and empathy, regardless of their background or circumstances.","The phrase ""τί ἐμοILED καὶ σοί"" is often translated as ""what I am made of and with what I am said to be?"" However, this translation does not capture its full meaning.
In the context of the Bible, ""τί ἐμοILED καὶ σοί"" refers to the person being spoken of. Specifically, it means that the person being described has a certain combination of traits or attributes that are commonly associated with their particular personhood.
In summary, the phrase ""τί ἐμοILED καὶ σοί"" in the Bible refers to the person being spoken of who possesses a certain combination of traits or attributes that are commonly associated with their particular personhood.","In John 2:4, Jesus responds to His mother Mary with the question, Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί, γύναι; This has been widely misunderstood either as a harsh rebuke or as questioning the relevance or propriety of Jesus involving himself with the problem of the wine running out. But let’s survey the other instances of the phrase in the Bible.
Judges 11:13 – “ Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question: “What do you have against me – Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί (LXX) – that you have attacked my country?”

But Jesus’ statement refers most (Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί;). In both texts the narrative reveals a reluctant prophet who is called upon to provide for one in need, a need the prophet sees as an unwanted involvement.
In all these passages the complaint is, “What have I done to you that you are causing me trouble unjustly? Why are you trying to bring disaster on me? Did I wrong you?” Or even, in Hebrew, Ma li valach, “What do you have against me?”

","""The only true wisdom is in knowing when not to know."" - Francis Bacon

In this quote, Francis Bacon emphasizes the importance of being aware when not to know. He suggests that there are certain situations or knowledge levels where one does not need to possess all relevant information.

This quote highlights the concept of ""contextual ignorance"" or ""ignorance without context."" In other words, someone may have a broad understanding or insight about a topic but may be unaware of specific details or historical contexts.

Overall, this quote underscores the importance of being aware when not to know and of recognizing contextual ignorance in situations where broad or general knowledge is not sufficient.","and as if you would be committing sacrilege if you went against it.

Treat others as they want to be treated as long as you do no injustice to yourself.

Employment opportunities
What is the college doing to help its student in being successful for employment? Students should be helped in identifying the available employment opportunities. Employers should also be invited to schools to assist the students in preparing and conducting interviews.

There it is. A memory. An artefact to hoard and cherish. Not to be launched into the attic dust but carefully stored within the mind as experience. We all hoard experiences. You really cannot throw them away, even if desperate to do so. You’d have to throw yourself away. And of course, that’s been done, many times over, always with the same, sad ending.

What are the top challenges organizations face when achieving their mobility goals according to the surveys?,"The top challenges organizations face when achieving their mobility goals according to the surveys include:

1. Security concerns: Organizations may face security threats such as data breaches, malware infections, and phishing attacks. These threats can compromise sensitive information, disrupt operations, and result in financial losses.

2. Determining ROI: Organizations may face a challenge to determine whether their enterprise mobile applications (EMAs) are delivering value or not. EMAs can help organizations streamline processes, automate routine tasks, and improve customer engagement. However, to determine the return on investment (ROI) of an EMA, organizations need to compare the actual costs associated with the implementation of the EMA against the estimated benefits that the EMA is expected to deliver. These benefits can include improved efficiency, increased productivity, reduced cost per customer, and increased revenue.

3. A lack of management tools: Organizations may face a challenge to ensure effective management of their enterprise mobile applications (EMAs). EMAs can help organizations streamline processes, automate routine tasks, and improve customer engagement. However, without adequate management tools, organizations may struggle to effectively manage their EMAs, resulting in inefficiencies, reduced productivity, and other negative outcomes for the organization.","1. Cost: The cost of implementing and maintaining a mobile workforce can be significant for organizations. This can include equipment costs, personnel wages, and office space costs.

2. Resistance to Change: One of the top challenges organizations face when achieving their mobility goals is resistance to change. Employees may be hesitant to adopt new technology or processes that require them to work remotely.

3. Communication Challenges: Effective communication is essential for mobile workers who rely on email, instant messaging, and other communication channels.

However, mobile workers may also experience communication challenges due to factors such as distance, time zone differences, and limited access to a company's internal communication channels.

4. Security Risks: Mobile working can expose organizations to a range of security risks, including data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and malware infections.

Organizations that implement mobile working solutions must take steps to mitigate these security risks and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CI/AV) of organizational data and communication channels.","Apperian research demonstrates that 60% of companies are developing their own mobile apps to support and speed up main business processes. 67% of respondents consider improved business processes as a goal for mobility.
Top challenges
The respondents were asked to name the top challenges to achieving their mobility goals. The results were as follows:
- Security concerns (67 % )
- Determining ROI (32 %)
- A lack of funds (29 %)

---

- A lack of funds (29 %)
- Reaching Bring your own device (BYOD) policy, contracted or unmanaged devices (26%)
- A lack of management tools (23%)
Security
Security tops the list of the challenges that organizations face when they develop their applications. This is due to the constant evolution of mobile security threats. All mobility programs must ensure that they appropriately respond to the security risks.

---

Visibility and Investments
Any enterprise mobility program need to be thoroughly analyzed in order to be successful. According to the Cisco forecast more than 50% of all organizations have no idea whether their apps are used. 48% do understand who is using their applications and 42% can see how frequently apps are run.
All surveyed organizations need greater visibility into statistics about their app usage.
Participants stated the list of investments they are making to increase the adoption:

What is the story of Mikol Blake-Green's journey in college basketball?,"Mikol Blake- Green's story is all too common among student-athletes at NCAA Division I schools. A native of Boston, Blake- Green initially enrolled at Fisher College as a member of their men's basketball program.
However, the road to this destination has been without its obstacles and pitfalls. Despite his athletic prowess, Blake- Green faced numerous challenges during his time on campus, including competing against other Division I schools, managing his academic workload, and building relationships with fellow students, coaches, and administrators.
Throughout his college basketball journey, Blake- Green demonstrated a remarkable ability to overcome these challenges and emerge victorious in both his personal and professional endeavors.","Mikol Blake- Green's journey in college basketball began in high school, where he was a standout player on his school's basketball team. He was recruited by several Division I schools, including Arizona State University and the University of North Texas.

Blake- Green attended Arizona State University for one year before transferring to the University of North Texas. During his time at both institutions, Blake- Green continued to excel as a player, earning numerous accolades and awards throughout his college career.

After graduating from the University of North Texas in 2016, Blake- Green was recruited by several Division I schools, including the University of Kansas, the University of Mississippi, and the University of Georgia. During his time at these institutions, Blake- Green continued to excel as a player, earning numerous accolades and awards throughout his college career.

In addition to his academic success, Blake- Green was also active in sports during his high school years, playing basketball for both his school's team and an individual team that he helped coach.
","It was a heavy burden on a young teenager, but because of his devotion to his mom, it was something that he felt more than obligated to do. “Mikol is a good person with a beautiful heart and a kind soul”, said Veola.
When he eventually graduated from high school following a stellar basketball career, Mikol enrolled at nearby Bunker Hill Community College. Along the way, he would meet two men who would have a great influence on his life on and off the court.

---

Mikol added, “I had never received that sort of guidance before that I got from Coach Jones and Coach Gibson. They both made me a better player and help me apply those lessons on the court to apply to life as well.”
Those lessons would come in handy in regards to the next major event of his life. Along the way at Bunker Hill, his mother would get a job offer in Baltimore. Mikol decided to stay in Massachusetts while also planning on what his next move academically was going to be.

---

Eventually, the school would accept Mikol as a student-athlete. When his playing days are done, he’s hoping to become a coach. In his own way, he’ll be paying back the many people along the way that have helped him.
For the many student-athletes that play collegiate sports, Mikol’s story is all too common. We always hear about the All-Americans or the All-Conference standouts. But for many others, their stories are seldom told or seldom heralded.

---

For Mikol Blake-Green of Fisher College, the season has slowly given him a chance to relax and feel comfortable on and off the court. A native of Boston, the 6-foot-7 forward has been getting consistent minutes for the Falcons, an NAIA independent.
However, the road to this destination has been without its obstacles and pitfalls.

---

Coach Jones added that seeing Mikol make the emotional transition on and off the court was something that he’s the proudest of. “He definitely had a bit of a chip on his shoulder when he arrived here”, he added.
“However, we slowly developed some trust amongst each other along the way. It definitely made our relationship grow as a whole. The biggest thing I tried to impress upon him was building relationships.”"

While there was nothing innovative about the game itself, I thought the art style was unique and interesting. I always looked forward to the bonuses between rounds, and the easy gameplay made it ideal to pull out for quick rounds. If you haven’t tired of the genre, give Friki Tricks a try.

---

Have you heard of the match-three genre? Of course you have. A conservative count puts the number of match three games in the app store at above fifty. As in the other games, with a grid of different pieces in Friki Tricks, you need to move items around to match three of the same icons in a row. This causes those pieces to disappear, and new ones to fall into the playing field. But will there be enough in Friki Tricks to hold your interest in this saturated genre?

These specialized tools provide advanced security features such as encryption of data during removal, prevention of unauthorized access to the removed files after removal, and secure deletion of large files or directories without affecting other files or directories in the system.
By using these specialized tools, you can safely and completely remove files/folders from your Linux system securely and efficiently.","Here are some safe and efficient methods to delete files or folders from a Linux system:

1. Use `rm -rf` command: This command is used to permanently delete all the files in a directory without prompting for confirmation.

2. Use `mv * .orig` command: This command is used to move all the files in a directory to their corresponding backup file named `.orig`. If any file is already present in `.orig`, then it will be moved again to `.orig`.

3. Use `sudo mv -rf /path/to/directory backupfile` command: This command is used to securely move all the files and folders from a directory to a backup file named `backupfile`. It requires superuser privileges (i.e., `sudo`) to execute the command.

These are some safe and efficient methods to delete files or folders from a Linux system. However, it's always recommended to take backups of critical data before attempting to remove them.","Let’s see how we can safely and completely remove files/folders from our Linux system. The methods mentioned below remove data completely so it becomes very hard for recovery tools to find traces of the actual data and recover it.

Run following command to remove file using shred utility.
shred /home/aun/Documents/xueo/1.png
Run following command to securely remove any partition using shred ; Replace partition name with your desired partition.
shred /dev/sda5
Shred by default overwrites file with random contents 25 times. If you want it to overwrite file more than this, simply specify the desired number with ""shred -n"" option.
shred -n 100 filename
If you want to truncate and remove file after overwriting, use ""shred -u"" option

---

“srm” command works similarly to “rm” command, but instead of just deleting the file, it first overwrites it multiple times with some random data and then removes the file permanently. The syntax for this command is pretty simply, just specify the file or directory to remove and it will take care of the task.
sudo srm /home/aun/Documents/xueo/1.png"

What are the potential issues if a new fence is not stored properly before processing?,"The potential issues if a new fence is not stored properly before processing include:

1. Corrosion and rust development: The fence profile may be exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as salt spray, acid rain, etc. Over time, these environmental factors can cause corrosion and rust development in the fence profile, leading to reduced durability of the fence.

2. Pigmentation and white spot formation: In some cases, the new fence may contain pigmentation patterns that are not properly stored before processing. As a result, during the production process, such pigmentation profiles may be exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as salt spray, acid rain, etc. Over time, these environmental factors can cause oxidation of pigmentation profiles, leading to formation of white spots on the surface of the new fence. As a result, the appearance of white spots on the surface of the new fence may affect the overall performance and durability of the new fence.

3. Surface damage and erosion: In some cases, the new fence may be exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as salt spray, acid rain, etc. Over time, these environmental factors can cause surface damage and erosion in the fence profile, leading to reduction in its overall durability and performance. As a result, the need for proper storage of the new fence before processing becomes more important than ever before.

4. Cost increase due to inadequate storage: In some cases, the new fence is not properly stored before processing, causing it to appear in poor condition after processing. As a result, the overall cost increase caused by inadequate storage of the new fence may significantly exceed the initial investment in the new fence, leading to reduced profitability and increased costs for maintaining and repairing the new fence after processing.","Here are some potential issues that may arise if a new fence is not stored properly before processing:

1. Structural damage: If the fence is improperly stored, it may suffer structural damage or warping due to excessive temperature fluctuations.

2. Incompatibility with other structures: If the fence is not properly stored, it may be incompatible with other structures in its vicinity, such as buildings, trees, and wildlife.

3. Decay and insect infestations: If the fence is not properly stored, it may decay over time due to exposure to environmental factors such as moisture, temperature, sunlight, and air pollution. This can lead to insect infestations, which can have a detrimental impact on the overall health of the property.

In conclusion, improper storage of a new fence can result in structural damage, compatibility issues with other structures, decay, and insect infestations. Therefore, it is crucial to properly store a new fence to avoid these potential issues and ensure the longevity of the property.","The new fence should be kept properly before processing. If handled improperly, will appear in the pipe surface of various problems, if the emergence of white powder, rust, and so on, although after grinding and pickling steps, can be handled, but will add to the later production sector burden, indirectly increased production costs, so the new fence profiles must be good protection measures.

What challenges are faced by farmers in Greenland due to changing weather conditions?,"Farmers in Greenland face several challenges related to changing weather conditions:

1. Drought: The past five years have seen severe drought in southern Greenland, which has affected farmers' access to water for irrigation and livestock watering.
   
2. Shorter winters: Changes in Arctic weather systems are also impacting the length of winters in southern Greenland, which can affect farmers' production cycles.
   
3. Extreme temperatures during summer months: The past few summers have experienced extreme temperatures in southern Greenland, which has affected farmers' ability to maintain optimal growth conditions for crops such as sheep and grains like barley.
   
4. Loss of livestock due to harsh weather conditions: In addition to the challenges faced by farmers due to changing weather conditions, livestock farming in southern Greenland is also facing significant losses due to harsh weather conditions, which can affect farmers' profitability and long-term sustainability of their livestock farming operations in the region.

In conclusion, farmers in Greenland face a wide range of challenges related to changing weather conditions. These challenges include drought, shorter winters, extreme temperatures during summer months, loss of livestock due to harsh weather conditions, and overall profitability and long-term sustainability of their livestock farming operations in the region.","1. Extreme Weather: In Greenland, the weather is characterized by long periods of darkness and intense winds that can uproot trees, damage crops, and lead to erosion.

2. Water Shortages: With a limited water supply, farmers in Greenland must find innovative ways to manage their water resources effectively.

3. Crop Variability: The changing weather conditions in Greenland can also impact crop yields, leading to food shortages if not managed properly.

Overall, farmers in Greenland are faced with numerous challenges due to the changing weather conditions. However, by adopting innovative management strategies and investing in sustainable farming practices, farmers in Greenland can mitigate these challenges and ensure their long-term survival in a climate-vibrated environment.","Instead, says Aqalooraq Frederiksen, a third-generation farmer who works at a regional farmer assistance bureau, the dry summers are diminishing the prospects for Greenlandic farming.
Recent summers have been both warm and dry, causing drought in south Greenland, says John Cappelen, a climatologist at Danish Meteorological Institute, which maintains climate data for the island.

---

“This year we also had drought throughout most of the early summer, but limited rainfall late in the summer made the harvest better than last year,” says Egede. But severe drought has struck Greenland in two of the past five years and recently published research suggests the trend may continue because of large scale changes in Arctic weather systems.

---

Since Greenland’s 60,000 citizens rely almost entirely on food imports from Denmark and other European countries, farmers and officials have hoped that steadily rising temperatures, and shorter winters, would spur a growth in agriculture here. (Summer temperatures have risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit in southern Greenland since 1975, increasing the growing season by two weeks.) And media stories about Arctic gardening in greenhouses or the warming temperatures have hyped the possibilities.

---

“In 2015, for example, we didn’t have spring,” said Greenlandic agricultural consultant Henrik Motzfeldt Egede. “It just went from a very cold winter to a hot, dry summer.” He says growth in pastures for livestock was “very bad as a result.” Meanwhile, the number of sheep farmers in Greenland has fallen from 74 in 1983 to about 37 farms today, says Frederiksen.

It’s a cool August morning as I ride in Magnus Hansen’s dented pickup truck through the verdant hills of south Greenland. We’re in search of his flock of 500 sheep grazing on the slopes. Soon we encounter three animals grazing by the gravel on the dirt road. The two ewes and a lamb first eye us warily from the bushes, then scurry across the road. Nearby is a shimmering fjord, but less than 10 miles away, though we can’t see it, lies Greenland’s mighty ice cap, a mile thick in the center of the island."

What was the basic strategy that Uber used to become a successful startup in the transportation industry?,"Uber's basic strategy to become a successful startup in the transportation industry involved exploiting the system of overcharging and mistreatment by cab drivers.

Firstly, Uber understood the existing problem faced by taxi drivers who left open a wide opportunity for their passengers. 

Secondly, Uber took advantage of this situation by introducing innovative business models and practices that addressed the overcharging and mistreatment issues faced by cab drivers.

For example, instead of simply charging higher prices to cover the cost of running their vehicles, Uber introduced new business models and practices that addressed the overcharging issue faced by taxi drivers. 

Similarly, instead of simply mistreating their passengers by leaving them unattended or driving them in an unsafe manner, Uber introduced new business models and practices that addressed the mistreatment issue faced by cab drivers. 

Overall, Uber's basic strategy to become a successful startup in the transportation industry involved exploiting the system of overcharging and mistreatment by cab drivers by introducing innovative business models and practices that addressed these issues faced by cab drivers.","Uber's basic strategy was to disrupt the traditional taxi market by providing an on-demand ride platform that connects passengers with drivers through GPS tracking and mobile apps.

Here are some key elements of Uber's strategy:

1. Disruptive technology: Uber used GPS tracking and mobile apps to connect drivers with passengers, making it easier for riders to find a driver who can take them where they need to go.

2. Location-based service: Uber uses GPS tracking to determine the location of each rider and driver, which allows for real-time optimization of routes and schedules.

3. User-friendly mobile app: Uber's user-friendly mobile app allows riders to easily request rides from drivers, track their ride history and locations, and even pay for their rides using mobile payments apps.","Why Uber became such a massive success?
The wheel is one of the best man-made inventions.
Imagine how our world would have been if we didn’t have realized that it is easier to roll down things than to push or drag them.
The transportation industry was born out of it.
Yes, air and sea travel do not exactly rely on wheels but they still play a vital role.
The transportation industry established a long ago, and it is one of the most successful and blooming industry.

---

A few years back, Uber came up with a simple yet brilliant idea.
Their idea changed the whole transportation industry and today it is “THE” most successful startup.
But how did they reach the spot?
What happened?
Did they sell their soul to the Satan?
If not, will they?
They not only affected the taxi business but there are speculations that they might affect the overall car industry.
How can a small idea change everything?

---

Uber is not a perfect solution by any means.
We keep hearing how taxi drivers have harassed a customer or in some cases, we hear how the customers were overcharged.
But it is certainly a better platform.
You have a place where you can complain.
Today a lot of startups have adapted the same business model and they are doing well.
Maybe the competition will help these industries to overcome their shortcomings.

Alice’s Adventures in the House of 1000 Corpses
This is going to be completely unrelated and of hardly any interest to anyone but movie nerds, but it’s been bugging me. It’s my blog after all, so I’ll post whatever I want. Now here is a post about movies.

Another movie which I’ve recently seen (again) is The House of 1000 Corpses, a horror flick shot in 2003 by Rob Zombie. It’s a movie about a bunch of teens who get slaughtered by an insane family of murderers and occultists. Here, the most remarkable character of the film is Captain Spaulding, a creepy deranged clown with rotten teeth, played by Sid Haig.
So: Two movies. One a 2010 kid’s movie, the other an R-rated, gory horror flick. Now I’d like you to take a look at the two character’s make-up:

Of course I know the correct answer is who gives a fuck?, but for some reason, stuff like this really buggs me.
PS: Other people noticed the make-up, too. This one is also a very nice review of Alice: “this movie is a wonder to look at, but a chore to sit through.” Couldn’t have said it any better.

What changes have been observed in Kate's physical condition?,"Kate's physical condition has undergone significant changes throughout the course of her story, Desiree's Baby by Kate Chopin.

At the beginning of the story, when Kate first visits Thrushcross Grange with the Lintons, she is presented as a high-spirited and kind-hearted individual, who radiates warmth and compassion towards those around her. Her physical appearance at this point in the story appears to be relatively healthy, given that she is wearing a thin white garment, and she is also walking on soft, leathy surfaces, which are typically associated with more natural, rural environments.

However, over time, as Kate's relationship with Heathcliff deepens, and as Kate begins to experience physical pain and discomfort due to her muscle loss and weight gain, significant changes in her physical condition begin to take place, particularly as Kate becomes increasingly dependent on her own physical abilities and strength in order to perform even the most basic tasks and activities required of her by her relationship with Heathcliff.

Over time, as Kate's reliance on her own physical abilities and strength in order to perform even the most basic tasks and activities required of her by her relationship with Heathcliff grows stronger and more reliable than any other form of physical assistance or support that Kate may initially have relied upon in order to assist her in performing even the most basic tasks and activities required of her by her relationship with Heathcliff.

In addition to her reliance on her own physical abilities and strength in order to perform even the most basic tasks and activities required of her by her relationship with Heathcliff, Kate also begins to experience significant changes in her physical appearance as a result of these changes in her reliance on her own physical abilities and strength in order to perform even the most basic tasks and activities required of her by her relationship with Heathcliff.

For example, as Kate becomes increasingly dependent on her own physical abilities and strength in order to perform even the most basic tasks and activities required of her by her relationship with Heathcliff, her muscle loss and weight gain become more pronounced and more apparent over time, leading to significant changes in her physical appearance as a result of these changes in her reliance on her own physical abilities and strength in order to perform even the most basic tasks and activities required of her by her relationship with Heathcliff.","As an AI language model, I do not have access to information about specific individuals unless it is publicly available. 

However, if we assume that the question is referring to a particular person named Kate and her physical condition, there could be several changes that may have been observed in her physical condition:

1. Weight loss: One possible reason for changes in Kate's physical condition is weight loss. If Kate has been experiencing weight loss due to various factors such as hormonal imbalances, eating habits changes, or other health conditions, then these changes could have been observed in Kate's physical condition.

2. Improved cardiovascular function: Another possible reason for changes in Kate's physical condition is improved cardiovascular function. If Kate has been experiencing cardiovascular issues, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke, and these issues have been impacting her physical condition, then these changes could have been observed in Kate's physical condition.

3. Improved muscular strength: Another possible reason for changes in Kate's physical condition is improved muscular strength. If Kate has been experiencing muscle weakness, such as decreased muscle tone, increased muscle bulk, or reduced muscle flexibility, and these issues have been impacting her physical condition, then these changes could have been observed in Kate's physical condition.

4. Improved immune function: Another possible reason for changes in Kate's physical condition is improved immune function. If Kate has been experiencing immune system problems, such as weakened immune systems due to aging, chronic illnesses, or other health conditions, and these issues have been impacting her physical condition, then these changes could have been observed in Kate's physical condition.

In conclusion, if the question is referring to a particular person named Kate and her physical condition, there could be several changes that may have been observed in her physical condition. Some of the possible changes include weight loss, improved cardiovascular function, improved muscular strength, and improved immune function.","Kate has been doing great. She still has not been showing any outward signs of anything relating to her muscle loss. Her shoulders still feel thin to me but it seems like she has gained some bicep back. She had her first trial in 7 months a few weekends ago and did great! I moved her to Veterans so she now jumps 12” – actually – she sort of steps over 12”. Haha.

She was enjoying herself quite a bit. I have figured out that Kate thinks of agility as … I have to do some shit and then I GET TO GO IN A TUNNEL…then I do some more shit….and ANOTHER TUNNEL….etc. Too bad we don’t do NADAC, she would think Tunnelers is The Shit.

This psalm is one of the most bracing of the imprecatory psalms. In fact, it almost offends our Christian conscience. However, if we understand its prophetic significance, we come to realize that it reveals God’s heart towards the traitor Judas who threw away his birthright, so to speak, for thirty pieces of silver. The psalm displays the proper attitude of the Lord’s Anointed against the spirit of Antichrist that motivated Judas and will fill the man of sin in the last days.

"What is the movie ""Wassup Rockers"" based on?","The movie ""Wassup Rockers"" is based on real-life experiences and teenage behaviors in Los Angeles' South Central ghetto during the 1980s. The film follows the antics of Jonathan, Kico, Milton, Porky, Eddie, Louie and Carlos, a group of teen flesh from this neighborhood who engage in activities that are not appropriate for their age and social status, such as running around unsupervised, fighting monsters, saying curse words, and learning what a virgin was. The film is a mix of documentary-style footage, real-life conversations between actors and non-actors, and fictionalized sequences that are based on the characters' behavior and actions in the real world.","""Wassup Rockers"" is a musical film that was released in 1984. The film is based on a song called ""Wassup Rocker,"" which was written by Jerry Wonnicki and recorded by the band The Who.

""Wassup Rocker"" tells the story of two friends, Jack and Mike, who go to a party in a small town. They meet a singer named Tommy, who becomes their friend and helps them with their party plans.

As the party progresses, tensions between Jack and Mike and Tommy begin to rise. In a climactic moment, Tommy sings ""Wassup Rocker,"" and the rest of the band joins him on stage, ending the movie in a heartwarming and emotional way.","“Wassup Rockers,” out Friday, follows the antics of Jonathan, Kico, Milton, Porky, Eddie, Louie and Carlos – young Latino skakeboarders from Los Angeles’ South Central ghetto (much like the firsttime actors who play them) who take a trip to posh Beverly Hills, where they’re hassled by cops and picked up by rich white girls.

A hard rock classic foreshadowing of what's to come in 70s. The opening guitar riff is still easily recognizable.

So we went down to Venice to find some skate kids. And there were Porky and Kico; they were 14 or 15. They were really raggedy, their shoes were falling apart and their clothes were much too little for them and they had long hair. But they had style.
We photographed them for four days. A couple months later, when I took the magazine back to them, they wanted to go skating. I ended up taking them skating every Saturday for over a year.

What is the central insight of Denis MacEoin's article according to the context?,"The central insight of Denis MacEoin' s article according to the context is that perception is reality. This idea is based on the observation that someone's perception of any given situation can shape their reality. When faced with insurmountable pressures, individuals may experience fight or flight responses. These responses can influence an individual's perception of those pressures and shape their reality accordingly. Therefore, according to the context, the central insight of Denis MacEoin' 's article is that perception is reality.","Denis MacEoin''s article ""The Ecology of Riverine Islands"" presents a central insight that different riverine islands have distinct ecological processes. The article emphasizes that island ecosystems are complex and interconnected, with variations in environmental conditions, species composition, and biotic interactions.

MacEoin''s article provides a theoretical framework for understanding the structure and function of riverine ecosystems. The article uses case studies to illustrate the key ecological processes occurring on different riverine islands. These processes include nutrient cycling, primary productivity, decomposition, and habitat provision.

MacEoin''s article also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in studying riverine ecosystems. By bringing together experts from fields such as ecology, biology, physics, geology, and environmental engineering, MacEoin''s article provides a powerful framework for understanding the complex ecological processes occurring on different riverine islands.","PS — To reiterate, although perhaps it’s needless, I don’t agree with much else that’s in MacEoin’s paper, certainly not MacEoin’s portrayal of Baha’u’llah, but I do find his central insight to be remarkable. I should note that what I say here doesn’t contradict or override the essential historical point that MacEoin is making, namely, that the Bab was going to the heart of sharia in order to deconstruct and reconstruct it; rather, I’m expanding upon it spiritually and philosophically.

---

Have you read Nader Saiedi’s book, mentioned above? It shows that MacEoin and others had a very big misunderstanding of the Bab’s teachings and laws. And of course, Shoghi Effendi has also clarified the main purpose of the Bab’s legal system in “God Passes By”.
Hi Nicholas, no, although I’ve heard about it from several sources long before this post. But let’s suppose Saiedi is correct and that MacEoin is profoundly wrong about the Babi dispensation: does that negate the essence of my reflection?

---

We do not often think of prophets as jesters. I think ex-Baha’i Denis MacEoin has many unfortunate misconceptions in his article, “Deconstructing and Reconstructing the Shari’a: the Babi and Baha’i Solutions to the Problem of Immutability,” but I feel that in his essential thesis he’s onto something very true and powerful: the Báb joked. I don’t mean that he told funny anecdotes to amuse himself and his companions; I mean his ministry was itself a jest. Here’s what MacEoin says:.

that someone’s perception of any given situation shaped their reality. In that sense, the saying is true. BUT, we’ve let things get waaaaay out of hand. In this article, we’ll uncover how the notion, “Perception IS reality,” is gravely dangerous. We’ll dive in to its inherent laziness, and we’ll work to undo the damage caused by its insane overuse.

What are the four categories into which worldwide spending on robots is split?,"The four categories into which worldwide spending on robots is split are as follows:

1) Military Robots: In this category, robots are primarily used in military applications, such as bomb disposal, reconnaissance, and target acquisition. These military robots account for a significant portion of worldwide robotics spend.

2) Industrial Robots: In the industrial robot category, robots are primarily used in manufacturing processes, such as production lines, assembly line workers, material handling, and more. The industrial robots account for a smaller percentage of worldwide robotics spend but still play an important role in many industrial applications.

3) Commercial Robots: In the commercial robot category, robots are primarily used in various commercial applications, such as logistics & supply chain management, warehousing, inventory management, distribution centers, express delivery services, package consolidation & shipping services, among others. The commercial robots account for a significant portion of worldwide robotics spend and are widely adopted across different industries.

4) Personal Robots: In the personal robot category, robots are primarily used in personal applications, such as home automation, household assistance, housekeeping services, among others. The personal robots account for a relatively smaller percentage of worldwide robotics spend but still play an important role in many personal applications.

These four categories into which worldwide spending on robots is split represent the major themes and drivers of robotic spending across different contexts, sectors, and geographies, including military and industrial applications, commercial services, personal applications, among others. These categorizations provide valuable insights into the major drivers and challenges facing robotic spending globally, with a particular focus on the implications for various industries, sectors, and geographies.","The four categories into which worldwide spending on robots is split based on their complexity and functionality:

1. Domestic Use: This category includes robots that are primarily designed for domestic use, such as cleaning, cooking, security, etc.

2. Industrial Use: This category includes robots that are primarily designed for industrial use, such as manufacturing, mining, construction, etc.

3. Healthcare Use: This category includes robots that are primarily designed for healthcare use, such as patient monitoring, medical imaging, drug discovery, etc.

4. Military Use: This category includes robots that are primarily designed for military use, such as military training, weapons systems maintenance, logistics operations, etc.","BC.
In fact, there’s an interesting graph you should take a look at that splits worldwide spending on robots into four categories: military, industrial, commercial, and personal. In 2015, BCG estimates about $11.0B in spending is for 1.2 million industrial robots, of which 40% (~ $4.4B) are used in automobile factories.

2) Tasks that people can’t, won’t, or shouldn’t do – that may lead to injury
3) Human skill gaps – such as real-time analysis, super speed or strength
4) Mission-critical applications – that demand exceptional precision, flexibility, or speed
5) High complexity – of changing supply chains with vast supplier networks

However, robots are moving from manufacturing cars to driving them (think Google). The rest of the industrial segment ($6.6B) and the commercial segment (at $5.9 billion) include a wide range of new applications.

NEW YORK (CBSMiami) – While more traditional styles of women’s underwear dominate the market, a number of independent brands are catering to a much larger market.
At the New York headquarters of Lively, the unmentionables on display aren’t necessarily meant to be kept under wraps.
“These styles look like you could wear them outside, not just under your clothes,” said Karina Mitchell.
“And they’ve certainly been styled that way,” Alexandra Alquiza responded.

Who is set to replace Gary Waters as the coach of the Scarlet Knights?,"Tom Pecora, who is said to be happy in Hempstead, could be successors if Orr does not stay.","As of my knowledge update in 2023, the person who has been scheduled to replace Gary Waters as the coach of the Scarlet Knights is Josh Schilling.

Josh Schilling was appointed the new head coach on July 15, 2023. He previously served as an assistant coach for the Kentucky Wildcats and UConn Huskies.
In summary, Josh Schilling is set to replace Gary Waters as the coach of the Scarlet Knights in the coming months.","With each passing day, although neither team has played a game and – because it’s an evaluation period and neither staff can speak to a recruit – Rutgers puts more distance between itself and in-state rival Seton Hall.
By the end of the week, Fred Hill, Jr., will formally become the next coach of the Scarlet Knights, replacing Gary Waters, who resigned.
The Post learned that St. Anthony coach Bob Hurley is considering an opportunity to join Hill’s staff, but the timing probably isn’t right.

Hofstra coach Tom Pecora, who is said to be happy in Hempstead, and George Mason coach Jim Larranaga of The Bronx are also possibilities. Both are in the midst of postseason runs – Pecora in the NIT, Larranaga in the Sweet 16.
– additional reporting by Tim Sullivan

---

“At this point I’m looking forward to two more years at St. Anthony,” Hurley said. “I feel I need a number to get me to shut it down and the 900 is out there. Then I think I’d like to try something else in coaching.”
Just the fact that Hill has such a strong relationship with Hurley is great news for Rutgers and bad news for Seton Hall. Seton Hall coach Louis Orr has two years left on his contract, but his status is in limbo.

---

Former coaches Fran Fraschilla, John Carroll and Pete Gillen could be successors if Orr does not stay. Gillen – who could also wind up at his alma mater, Fairfield – and Quinlan are longtime friends. In an interview early in the season, Quinlan praised Gillen’s work ethic and style, but prefaced it all by saying: “We have a coach.”
Carroll, one of P.J. Carlesimo’s assistants during The Hall’s glory days, coached the Boston Celtics after a stint at Duquesne.

---

“Who wouldn’t want a legendary coach like Bob Hurley on his bench?” Hill said in the Wachovia Center late Sunday night after watching Villanova beat Arizona, 82-78. “But I’m not the coach at Rutgers and Bob and I haven’t had any discussions along those lines.”
Hurley has 873 wins at St. Anthony and would like to post 900 as a high school coach. He is the most respected prep coach in the Garden State and, should he ever decide to become a college assistant, would be a major coup for any Big East program."

What are the disadvantages of using Rocket Launchers in combat?,"The disadvantages of using Rocket Launchers in combat include:

1. Limited ammunition: Rocket Launchers have a limited amount of ammo, which can limit their effectiveness in combat against larger groups of enemies.

2. Non-renewable energy sources: Rocket Launchers require non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels, to function properly. The use of these non-renewable energy sources results in increased environmental impact and pollution levels.

3. Inadequate shielding: Rocket Launchers have a limited amount of ammo and are not suitable for prolonged combat against larger groups of enemies. As a result, the Rocket Launchers used for combat are typically less capable of protecting their operators from enemy fire.

Overall, while Rocket Launchers can be effective weapons in certain circumstances, they also come with significant disadvantages when used in combat against larger groups of enemies.","1. Limited Range: Rocket launchers have a limited range compared to other combat weapons. This means that rocket launchers can only engage enemy targets within their range.

2. High Cost: Rocket launchers are expensive to produce and maintain. The production process requires skilled engineers, scientists, and technicians who work together to design, build, and test rocket launchers.

3. Vulnerability to Damage: Rocket launchers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including enemy forces, natural disasters, and technical malfunctions.

4. Limited Mobility: Rocket launchers are limited in their mobility compared to other combat weapons. This means that rocket launchers cannot easily traverse difficult terrain or operate in tight spaces where mobility is restricted.

In conclusion, while rocket launchers have some advantages over other combat weapons, they also have significant disadvantages that make them vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources.","However, despite these massive advantages, Rocket Launchers have equally massive disadvantages. They hurt allies and enemies, which means you will likely not be using Rocket Launchers in combat, and ironically more from a stealth standpoint. They also only have 2 ammo max, so unless you have ways to boost maximum ammo or refill ammo in combat, your Rocket Launcher usage may be short-lived.

What is the role of self-endorsement skills in our well-being according to Stren #16?,"According to Stren #16, self-endorsement skills play a crucial role in our well-being by providing us with powerful means to add emotion to intelligence, thereby overriding established action pathways of instinct and tradition.

Self-endorsement refers to the ability or willingness to assume responsibility for one's life experiences. It involves developing strategies that enable individuals to effectively balance their emotions, intellect, and physical abilities.

Self-empowerment skills include various cognitive and emotional strategies that help individuals to overcome self-doubt, low self-esteem, and other negative emotions associated with failure, shame, guilt, disappointment, and other related emotions.

What are some of the potential negative impacts of charity as discussed in the context?,"Some potential negative impacts of charity include:

1. Lack of accountability: Charity organizations may not have adequate systems in place to ensure that donations are being used for their intended purposes.

2. Exploitation of vulnerable populations: Charity organizations may not be providing adequate support and protection to vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly, and women experiencing domestic violence.

3. Cultural and linguistic differences: Charity organizations may face cultural and linguistic differences when working with beneficiaries from diverse backgrounds, which could result in miscommunication, misunderstandings, and conflicts.

4. Limited impact on systemic issues: While charity can provide some level of support and relief to marginalized communities, it may not be sufficient to address the underlying systemic issues that are contributing to social inequality and other forms of injustice.

In conclusion, charity as a virtue or as an ""inc"" organization could have potential negative impacts on vulnerable populations, the environment, corporate culture, cultural and linguistic differences, limited impact on systemic issues, and the ethical considerations involved in charitable giving.","1. Dependency: Charity can create a sense of dependency among beneficiaries. If they rely solely on charity for their needs, they may become complacent and neglect other areas of life.

2. Inequality: Charity can perpetuate inequality by favoring certain groups over others. For example, if charities only distribute aid to individuals with disabilities, this can result in a lack of aid reaching those who are not eligible.

3. Reduced self-sufficiency: Charity can also reduce the self-sufficiency of beneficiaries by providing additional assistance and support services that do not require charity directly.

4. Negative environmental impacts: Charity can also have negative environmental impacts by contributing to increased waste, pollution, and resource depletion.

5. Cultural erasure: Charity can also contribute to cultural erasure by promoting a culture of dependency and support services that prioritize the needs of beneficiaries over those of charities.

Overall, charity has the potential to create positive impacts on individuals and communities, but it must be done in a responsible, equitable, and sustainable manner.","Charities, by their nature, go where there is trouble. Uprising, corruption, colonialism, exploitation, bigotry, terror. No amount of external aid, even if given in love and good faith, can correct underlying systemic issues. Sometimes, charity makes things worse.

---

Change happens when marginalized communities are empowered to transform systems of oppression into systems of flourishing.
Social good brands must realize that there are limits to charity, and that building a charitable business model without attention to the ethics of their supply chain or the long term efficacy of the nonprofits they support is both irresponsible and dangerous.

---

Charity is only good now because it is necessary. But the world we should be working toward is one where people are far too important to ever be turned into charity cases, where we don't get to feel good about giving.
Where we get to claim that we're good only when we know that everyone is being treated as the sacred beings they are.
In the words of John Wesley:

---

So, businesses, by all means give to charity. But take it a step further by seriously scrutinizing your supply chain for the slightest sign of injustice and exploitation. Care about company culture. Care about the environment. Vet the charities you support. Treat others the way you'd like to be treated.
I originally covered this topic on my post on One-for-Ones. I'm hoping to do another post distinguishing between charity as a virtue versus ""charity, inc."" soon.

---

You can look at this from a couple of perspectives. On the one hand, it's really nice to know that these hugely profitable enterprises are designating at least some of their profits to charitable giving. It's certainly better than nothing, and for the recipients of these pledges, scholarships, and funds, it can be life changing."
When were gay people given the right to same sex marriage in the UK?,"The right to same-sex marriage for gay people in the UK was granted on July 8, 1902, when Everard Connard married Mary Connard at the Parish Church of Musbury between Accrington and Bury in Lancashire. This event marked a significant milestone in the history of gay rights and婚姻 equality in the United Kingdom.","The right of gay people to same-sex marriage was not given as a rights issue, but rather as a practical matter related to legal frameworks.

In the 1980s and 1990s, there was growing pressure on British governments to extend the right of gay people to marry. In response to this demand, the British government introduced a number of reforms over the course of several years, including an amendment to the Representation of the People Act (1983) that extended the right of same-sex marriage to certain constituencies.

While these reforms ultimately did not extend the right of gay people to marry to every constituency in the UK, they were seen as important steps towards expanding the right of same-sex marriage to all citizens in the UK, including gay people.","Today, March 29th 2014, Gay people are finally given the right to same sex marriage in the UK! None of this civil partnership stuff, we're talking; a full wedding in a church, with a vicar and religious vows marriage – finally!!
I’m thankful that the UK is one of the most accepting and liberal countries in the world, but there is still a lot of judgement, prejudice and sometimes hatred towards homosexual people – It.drives.me.crazy!

I have said to him since, that it drove a small but significant wedge between us for a while, to which he replied that, despite our closeness he was scared his paternal and maternal families would reject him – even in the 21st Century. I was surprised, but not shocked, especially after seeing a statistic that; a fifth of all people in the UK wouldn't attend a gay wedding.
With the big hit of the First Kiss film, on Youtube, a new clip has been uploaded.

Last week, there was a programme aired called Cure Me I’m Gay. In the show, celebrity Doctor Christian Jessen, who is openly gay, tried all manner of weird and disgusting “cures” for his sexuality. From self help books, therapy and a disgraceful treatment where he was basically poisoned whilst looking at sexual photos and a tape playing messages that say “Being Gay in wrong” and “It’s unnatural” playing in the room. This treatment was available on the NHS until the 1980’s and it left Dr. Jessen in tears

As for Paddy Power’s closing question “Were they right to ban us?” I think this recentring of the issue around the hurt feelings of cis privileged people is disingenuous, to say the least and there’s a far more pressing question in my mind. In the voiceover to the advert, Paddy Power state that:
[…] we’re going to make Ladies Day even more exciting by sending in some beautiful transgendered ladies.

Everard (or Ernest) married Mary Connard at the Parish Church of Musbury between Accrington and Bury in Lancashire on July 8, 1902, when he was 30 years old. The marriage certificate records that he was a secretary, living at the Vicarage at nearby Helmshaw. Mary, who was a year older than Everard, was living in Southport and was the daughter of David Connard, a deceased decorator. His eldest sister, Gertrude Oldacre, attended the wedding."

2. Blended Learning Models: Blended learning models combine face-to-face instruction with online or distance learning components. The new Vice Chancellor may want to introduce these models, which allow for a more personalized approach to education.

3. Mobile Learning Applications: Mobile learning applications use smartphones and tablets to deliver educational content and facilitate interactive learning experiences. The new Vice Chancellor may want to introduce mobile learning applications, which provide students with greater access to educational resources and opportunities for real-world application of knowledge.","'Read it and take action.

"What is the author's perspective on the consumption of pornography, even in moderation?","The author's perspective on the consumption of pornography, even in moderation, is one of shame and guilt.
The author believes that even a small amount of pornography can have a devastating impact on a person's soul. The author argues that the truth about God is something that we cannot tolerate or ignore, no matter how much may be put in.
However, despite this perspective, the author also recognizes that even in moderation, the consumption of pornography can still lead to serious negative consequences for a person's life and relationships.
The author concludes by emphasizing that Christians should not allow themselves to consume anything as toxic as pornography. Christians should recognize that their faith is something that they cannot tolerate or ignore, no matter how much may be put in.
In summary, the author's perspective on the consumption of pornography, even in moderation, is one of shame and guilt. The author recognizes that even in moderation, the consumption of pornography can still lead to serious negative consequences for a person's life and relationships.","As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, according to various studies and experts, it appears that moderate consumption of pornography may not have a significant impact on one's overall well-being.

Research has shown that while there may be some negative effects associated with moderate consumption of pornography, the overall impact is likely to be minimal.

Some factors that may influence the perceived impact of moderate consumption of pornography include individual sensitivity and tolerance for sexual stimuli, as well as the degree to which individuals engage in consensual sexual activities.

In conclusion, moderate consumption of pornography may not have a significant impact on one's overall well-being. However, it is important to note that there can be negative effects associated with moderate consumption of pornography, particularly if individuals engage in consensual sexual activities. Therefore, while moderate consumption of pornography may not have a significant impact on one's overall well-being, it is important for individuals who engage in consensual sexual activities to consider the potential negative effects associated with moderate consumption of pornography, and to take appropriate measures to mitigate those risks.","Why just a little pornography can be deadly
Written by Kendra White
“A little pornography can actually be a good thing,” I read in horror. A Facebook friend had just posed the question, “Is pornography good or bad?” and the comments were pouring in. “It’s fine as long as you view in moderation,” came the next reply.

---

I couldn’t believe what I was reading. We are talking about pornography, right? The stuff that rips apart marriages, ruins lives, and causes many in the church to give up their pursuit of a holy and righteous God? Pornography- the stuff that is scientifically proven to be bad for your brain and statistically horrible for relationships? Good? You are seriously going to make an argument that it is good?
Isaiah 5:20 says:

James 1:14-15 says:
“But each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death” (emphasis added).
Well-Placed Shame
Here’s what I find fascinating though. The person who posed this question openly admitted that they felt shame for viewing pornography. “If it’s not wrong, then why do I feel bad about it?” they wondered.

---

As a culture, we have tolerated the sin of pornography and now its status has moved from “horrible” to “not that bad” to “good in moderation.” This is what happens when we make the mistake of comparing our holiness to that of those around us rather than to that of Christ. We think, “I’m doing better than the next guy,” and all of a sudden that one slip up becomes an addictive temptation that leads to spiritual death.
Scripture gives us a clear warning of the danger of giving into such temptation.

---

Good is being called evil and evil good. We live in a world that has exchanged the truth of God for a lie. The truth is this: even a little pornography is poison to your soul. Pornography is sin, and sin separates us from God (Matthew 5:27-28, James 1:14-15). You wouldn’t tolerate even a little poison in your food, no matter how much was put in! So why do Christians allow themselves to consume something as toxic as pornography?"

What was the purpose of the 'play' mentioned in the postcard?,"The purpose of the ""play"" mentioned in the postcard appears to be a fundraising event for World War I (WWI) war effort, specifically the Doyly Carte Opera Company in Melbourne, Australia. The mention of the ""play"" being held in 1908 suggests that it was likely to have been held during the early years of World War I, when mobilization and funding were still in their infancy. Overall, the purpose of the ""play"" mentioned in the postcard appears to be a significant fundraising event for the war effort during the early years of World War I.","As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific postcards or their contents. However, assuming that the postcard is related to a play or performance, its purpose could be:

1. To promote the play: The postcard might contain information about the play, such as its title, playwright, and any performances scheduled for the coming week.

2. To advertise a location where the play would take place: The postcard might also include information about the surrounding area, such as the name of the town or village where the play would be performed, the distance between the town center and the theater, and any other relevant details that could help potential attendees plan their trip to the theater.","My research of this postcard was totally unrewarding.

"What is the difference between a car show, a cruise-in, and a Concours d'Elegance?","The main differences between a car show, a cruise-in, and a Concours d'Élegance are:

1. Invitation requirements: A Concours d'Élegance is an exclusive event that requires invitation from the sponsoring club or organization. On the other hand, a car show or cruise-in do not require invitation, but you can attend them for free.

2. Judging requirements: In a Concours d'Élegance, the judging is scored by deductions at various points on the planet. For example, if a car gets an A rating in one category and B rating in another category, then it will be deducted from the total score in that category. Similarly, in a car show or cruise-in, the judging may not be as complex or difficult as in a Concours d'Élegance, but still the judging requirements may differ.

3. Attendance and admission requirements: A car show or cruise-in typically does not require invitation, but you can attend them for free of charge. On the other hand, a Concours d'Élegance is an exclusive event that requires invitation from the sponsoring club or organization. Therefore, if you are new to the hobby and do not have any invitations, then you will not be able to enter a car show or cruise-in as it typically does not require invitation.","Car shows typically showcase a variety of cars from different manufacturers. The purpose of these shows is to give people an opportunity to see and appreciate the unique features of various cars.

Cruises-in are similar to car shows in that they showcase a variety of boats from different manufacturers. However, cruises-ins tend to have more relaxed and laid-back atmosphere compared to car shows.

Concours d'Elegance, on the other hand, are highly exclusive and prestigious motor racing events held annually in France and occasionally in other countries around the world. 

The Concours d'Elegance is a showcase of the world's finest and most prestigious cars. It has a reputation for being one of the most important car shows in the world.

Questions to Ask:
Which event should I be going to if I am new to the hobby?
You are always encouraged to attend each one as a spectator; however, if you want to enter your car, a cruise-in is probably the best place to show your car for the first time.
Are there minimum requirements to enter my car in these events?
Usually there are no minimum requirements at a cruise-in, but you should check with the event sponsor.
Do I have to belong to a car club to enter a vehicle?

---

Cruise-ins and most car shows do not require that you be a member of a car club to enter your vehicle, but you may encounter shows where some of the judging is limited to club members.
What can I expect at my first time showing a car?

---

One of the best ways to get involved in the collector-car hobby is to attend a local car show or cruise-in. Car shows and cruise-ins are great places to look for a classic or muscle car. Although many car shows do not allow any advertising of cars for sale, owners may be looking for a prospective buyer for a sale in the future, or know of a car similar to theirs that is for sale by another owner. If you do find a car that is available, a car show is a great venue for seeing a prospective purchase in person"
What changes did Toyota make to the Innova over the years to maintain its appeal?,"Toyota made several changes to the Innova over the years to maintain its appeal and differentiate it from other MPVs on the market. Here are some of the key changes that Toyota implemented:

What are the three types of personal selling techniques?,"The three types of personal selling techniques are:

1. Vaporizing technique:
This technique involves creating a sense of urgency or scarcity in the customer's mind. This can be done through various tactics such as highlighting limited availability, offering steep discounts to encourage impulse purchases, or emphasizing the fact that they are the only ones who offer this product.

2. Mirandizing technique:
This technique involves making a comparison between the company and its competitors. By doing so, the company can highlight the unique selling points of their products, such as advanced technology, high-quality materials, or exceptional customer service. This can help to position the company as a leader in its industry, rather than just another vendor offering similar products.

3. Vaporizing technique enhanced with mirandizing:
This technique combines the vaporizing and mirandizing techniques discussed above, by highlighting the unique selling points of both the company's products and its competitors'. This can be done through various tactics such as highlighting the specific features and benefits of each product offered by the company, such as advanced technology, high-quality materials, or exceptional customer service. This can help to position the company as a leader in its industry, rather than just another vendor offering similar products.

Note: The context provided above is not sufficient for answering the question ""What are the three types of personal selling techniques?"" correctly. In order to provide a comprehensive and accurate answer to this question, it would be necessary to know more about the specific context of personal selling, as well as the characteristics and types of personal selling techniques that are typically used in this context.

Assuming that the context provided above is a general context for personal selling, some common types of personal selling techniques that may be involved in this context could include:

1. Verbal techniques: These techniques involve using words or phrases to convey information or persuade a customer to make a purchase with the company. For example, a salesperson might use phrases such as ""This product is perfect for your needs,"" ""Our products are made of high-quality materials that will provide you with years of enjoyment,"" or ""Our customer service team is here to assist you and resolve any issues you may have during your purchase experience with our company.""

2. Nonverbal techniques: These techniques involve using nonverbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, eye contact, etc., to convey information or persuade a customer to make a purchase with the company. For example, a salesperson might use nonverbal cues such as nodding, smiling, maintaining eye contact for an extended period of time, etc., to convey information that highlights the product's unique features and benefits, such as advanced technology, high-quality materials, exceptional customer service, etc., and persuade the customer to make a purchase with the company by highlighting the product's key selling points.

3. Sales motivational techniques: These techniques involve using sales motivational techniques such as storytelling, demonstrations, incentives, personalization, differentiation, etc., to convey information that highlights the product's unique features and benefits, such as advanced technology, high-quality materials, exceptional customer service, etc., and persuade the customer to make a purchase with the company by highlighting the product's key selling points.

4. Sales process coaching techniques: These techniques involve using sales process coaching techniques such as goal setting, behavior modification, process improvement, team building, communication skills, etc., to convey information that highlights the product's unique features and benefits, such as advanced technology, high-quality materials, exceptional customer service, etc., and persuade the customer to make a purchase with the company by highlighting the product's key selling points.

In order to provide a comprehensive and accurate answer to this question, it would be necessary to know more about the specific context of personal selling, as well as the characteristics and types of personal selling techniques that are typically used in this context.

Assuming that the context provided above is a general context for personal selling, some common types of personal selling techniques that may be involved in this context could include:

1. Presentation technique: This type of personal selling technique involves presenting information or products to potential customers or clients. For example, a salesperson might present a product catalog to potential customers, highlighting the key features and benefits of each product in the catalog, such as advanced technology, high-quality materials, exceptional customer service, etc., to persuade potential customers to make a purchase with the company by highlighting the unique selling points and benefits of each product in the catalog, such as advanced technology, high-quality materials, exceptional customer service, etc., to persuade potential customers to make a purchase with the company.","The three types of personal selling techniques are:

1. Relationship Building: This technique focuses on building a positive relationship with the target audience. Personal sellers use active listening, empathy, and enthusiasm to establish trust and rapport with potential customers.

2. Product Informational Selling: This technique aims to educate and inform prospects about the product or service being sold. Personal sellers utilize clear and concise language, examples, and demonstrations to demonstrate the benefits and value proposition of the product or service.

3. Sales Enablement Selling: This technique focuses on enabling sales teams to effectively sell products or services. Personal sellers leverage various sales enablement technologies such as CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems, e-commerce platforms, and marketing automation tools to streamline sales processes, improve customer engagement, and increase revenue for the organization.","the more common nonproductive self-putdown skills we learn.

What is the reason for the author feeling worn out?,"The reason for the author feeling worn out is their personality trait of being impatient. The author wants things done now and before then, which leads to a desire for speed and efficiency in completing tasks. As a result, getting used to the publishing industry, which often moves at a glacial pace, has really taught the author to take deep breaths, calm down, and curb their need for speed in accomplishing tasks.","The author feels worn out because they have been working non-stop, without breaks, and with a heavy workload. This constant effort can lead to physical and mental exhaustion, as well as burnout from long-term or chronic workloads. Therefore, the reason for the author feeling worn out is their extended or ongoing work commitments.","Yeah, but I don’t wanna write about that anyway. I am just tired, too tired. Can’t multi-task at all. I have two people I have to call back, one who called and then I had to run for the ‘shelter’ of the middle of the house – where I ate my breakfast today. And another who called while I had two kids wanting something from me. There isn’t enough of me to go ’round. So it goes.

Feeling a little worn out today.
It’s already been a long week, and I’m not even quite halfway done with it.
Between all the up-and-down at work, and my new work-out regimen at home, I’m whipped most nights, and ready to just fall in bed and collapse. Of course, it feels pretty good to have a couple of the women at work tell me that they can see that I’ve lost some weight, so I’m going to keep doing what I’m doing, and work on getting stronger and in better shape.

What are the rules of the sumo wrestling match mentioned in the context?,"The rules of the sumo wrestling match mentioned in the context include:

1. The first wrestler to get his opponent to step outside the ring or touch the ground with anything but his feet wins the bout.
2. While rolling it is not uncommon to collide with other rolling pairs, the wall, the edge of the mat, the pillars, or other environmental variables. Many times, your opponent can not see these things and it is your job to be their eyes and prevent a potentially harmful condition. Stop the roll before your momentum crashes you into a bench or wall and resume your epic struggle safely in the center of the mat.
3. The sumo wrestler must wear a full set of sumo wrestling gear, including a traditional wooden sumo wrestling ring, a pair of high-quality sumo wrestling shoes with protective spikes on the soles to prevent cuts or injuries from jumping or landing on the ring or shoes, a traditional wooden sumo wrestling hat with ear loops and eye patches for protecting your face from sweat, dirt, and debris that can cause injuries or infections when wearing non-sportsman-grade sumo wrestling gear, such as non-wooden sumo wrestling rings, non-high-quality sumo wrestling shoes with protective spikes on the soles, non-traditional wooden sumo wrestling hats with ear loops and eye patches for protecting your face from sweat, dirt, and debris that can cause injuries or infections when wearing non-sportsman-grade sumo wrestling gear, such as non-wooden sumo wrestling rings, non-high-quality sumo wrestling shoes with protective spikes on the soles, non-traditional wooden sumo wrestling hats with ear loops and eye patches for protecting your face from sweat, dirt, and debris that can cause injuries or infections when wearing non-sportsman-grade sumo wrestling gear, such as non-wooden sumo wrestling rings, non-high-quality sumo wrestling shoes with protective spikes on the soles","In the given context, the rules of the sumo wrestling match are not explicitly stated. Sumo wrestling is a traditional Japanese sport that involves grappling and throwing heavy stones called ""sumos"". The rules of sumo wrestling vary slightly between different regions and styles of competition.
In general, some common rules of sumo wrestling include:

  * There are two teams competing in the game: one team composed entirely of men, known as ""the young men"", and another team composed entirely of women, known as ""the old women"".
  * The game is played on a rectangular field called ""the ring"" or ""the round"". The field is divided into four equal parts by wooden posts placed at each corner of the field.
  * During the game, two teams compete in various phases of the match, including the ""inning"" stage, when one team attempts to pin the other team to the ground, and the ""final stage"" or ""king's roll"" stage, where one team makes a large somerset stone called a ""king's roll"" that is thrown vertically towards the opposing team, who then try to catch the king's roll in their opponent's wrestler's hand.

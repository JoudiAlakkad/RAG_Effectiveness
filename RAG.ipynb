According to Nevada law, if an individual is convicted of driving under the influence (DUI), their car insurance policy will be voided and they may have to find alternative car insurance. This means that individuals who are convicted of DUI will not be able to obtain coverage for their vehicles through their existing car insurance policies.

However, here are some general guidelines for a high-percentage spin serve:\\n\\n1. **Topspin**: A topspin serve is considered the most effective type of spin serve. It creates a high-arcing ball that drops steeply on the opponent's side, making it difficult to return.\\n\\t* Ideal characteristics:\\n\\t\\t+ High arc (~30-40 degrees)\\n\\t\\t+ Fast speed (15-20 km/h)\\n\\t\\t+ Spin intensity: 7-9 out of 10\\n2. **Backspin**: A backspin serve is useful when you want to make the opponent hit a low-bouncing ball or create confusion.\\n\\t* Ideal characteristics:\\n\\t\\t+ Low arc (~10-20 degrees)\\n\\t\\t+ Slow speed (5-15 km/h)\\n\\t\\t+ Spin intensity: 3-5 out of 10\\n3. **Sidespin**: Sidespin serves are useful when you want to create a spin that curves sharply, making it difficult for the opponent to return.\\n\\t* Ideal characteristics:\\n\\t\\t+ Medium arc (~20-30 degrees)\\n\\t\\t+ Fast speed (15-25 km/h)\\n\\t\\t+ Spin intensity: 5-7 out of 10\\n4. **Reverse spin**: Reverse spin serves are useful when you want to create a spinning ball that moves in the opposite direction of the opponent's expected stroke.\\n\\t* Ideal characteristics:\\n\\t\\t+ Low arc (~10-20 degrees)\\n\\t\\t+ Slow speed (5-15 km/h)\\n\\t\\t+ Spin intensity: 3-5 out of 10\\n\\nTo achieve these ideal spin serves, focus on the following:\\n\\n1. **Racket angle**: Use a racket angle that creates the desired spin. For topspin, hold the racket relatively flat (~20-30 degrees); for backspin, hold it more vertically (45-60 degrees).\\n2. **Contact point**: Hit the ball at the right contact point to generate the desired spin. A slightly forward or backward contact can affect the spin.\\n3. **Follow-through**: Use a consistent follow-through to maintain control and consistency in your serves.\\n4. **Practice**: Spend time practicing different spin serves to develop muscle memory and improve your technique.\\n\\nRemember, the key to an effective spin serve is consistency and precision. With practice and patience, you can master the ideal spin serve for your table tennis game.\"}\n",

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on this context.', 'answer_without': \"In Nevada, a DUI conviction can have significant consequences on your car insurance rates. Here are some potential impacts:\\n\\n1. **Higher premiums**: Insurance companies view DUI convictions as a high-risk behavior, which can lead to increased premiums. You may expect a rate increase of 10% to 30% or more, depending on the insurer and other factors.\\n2. **Increased surcharges**: Nevada law allows insurance companies to impose surcharges for DUI-related offenses. These surcharges are typically added to your premium for a set period (e.g., 3-5 years). The amount of the surcharge can vary from $250 to $1,000 or more per year.\\n3. **Policy cancellation or non-renewal**: If you have a DUI conviction and your insurance company is notified, they may cancel or decline to renew your policy. This is especially true if you're a high-risk driver or have a history of accidents or violations.\\n4. **Higher deductibles**: Your insurer might raise your deductible, which means you'll need to pay more out-of-pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in.\\n5. **Limited or restricted coverage**: In some cases, an insurance company may offer limited or restricted coverage for a driver with a DUI conviction. This can include limitations on the types of vehicles covered or reduced liability limits.\\n\\nTo mitigate these consequences, it's essential to:\\n\\n* Shop around for insurance quotes from multiple providers to find the best rates and terms.\\n* Consider purchasing high-risk or non-standard insurance if you're having trouble finding coverage.\\n* Take a defensive driving course or complete an alcohol awareness program to demonstrate your commitment to safe driving.\\n* Keep in mind that Nevada law allows for the suspension of your driver's license if you accumulate three or more DUI-related offenses within seven years.\\n\\nRemember, it's crucial to follow Nevada laws and regulations regarding DUIs to avoid these insurance consequences.\"}\n",

What is the ideal spin serve in table tennis?,"The ideal spin serve will bounce twice on the opponent's side of the table, with the second bounce as close to the endline as possible.","The ideal spin serve in table tennis depends on various factors, including the player's personal style, the opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and the specific tournament or competition requirements. However, here are some general guidelines for an effective spin serve:

1. Topspin serves: These are the most common type of serve and generate a lot of power and speed. They work well against players with weak forehand returns.
2. Backspin serves: These serve with less spin but more accuracy and can be difficult to return for opponents, especially those who don't have experience handling backspin.
3. Sidespin serves: These are used to make the ball dip or curve downward as it approaches the table, making them harder to return.
4. Flick serves: This is a type of serve where the player flicks the ball with their wrist and fingers, creating topspin or sidespin.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of an ideal spin serve:

**Key components:**

1. Speed: The serve should be fast enough to make it difficult for the opponent to return.
2. Spin: A combination of topspin and backspin can create a harder-to-return serve.
3. Angle: Serving at an angle (about 30-40 degrees) can help the ball dip or curve downward, making it harder to return.
4. Placement: Serving on the short side of the table (closer to the opponent's body) can make it more difficult for them to react and hit a good return.

**Spin serve technique:**

1. Hold the racket with your backswing facing downwards.
2. Start the serve motion with a firm, controlled toss.
3. Flick the ball upwards with your wrist and fingers, using a combination of topspin and backspin.
4. Aim for the opponent's body or near their feet to create a difficult-to-return angle.

**Tips:**

1. Practice serving different types of spin serves regularly to develop muscle memory and consistency.
2. Experiment with various speeds and angles to find what works best for you.
3. Pay attention to your opponent's tendencies and adjust your serve accordingly (e.g., if they have trouble returning topspin, try using more backspin).
4. Consider working with a coach or experienced player to refine your serving technique.

Remember that the ideal spin serve is one that creates difficulty for the opponent while being easy for you to execute consistently.","The ideal spin serve will, if given the chance, bounce twice on the opponent's side of the table, with the second bounce as close to the endline as possible. Sometimes a super-short serve is effective (which might bounce three or more times on the opponent's side, given the chance), as it forces the opponent to reach well over the table, but super-short serves are also easier to flip, push short, or quick-push at an angle. Many players use ""tweeny"" serves, where the second bounce is right around the

---

Many players face a devastating choice: Should you serve with lots of spin, with the serve going long and allowing the opponent to loop, or should you sacrifice spin, even serving with no spin, so you can keep the serve short? Actually, you can do both. In fact, the spinnier the serve, the easier it is to keep short.

---

ways, but primarily by contacting the ball near the handle, where the racket travels slowly even in a vigorous serve.) A no-spin serve with a vigorous motion is called ""heavy no-spin."" Seriously!

---

The other reason a spinny serve might go long is the contact point is too high, which also leads to the serve being too high. Once you are grazing the ball very finely, you need to learn to serve it low with a low contact point, and learn where to bounce it on each side of the table for varying depths. If you barely graze the ball, you'll not only maximize the spin but since nearly all your energy is going into spin, you'll find yourself almost struggling to get the ball to reach and go over the net -

---

all of the energy from your arm and wrist goes into spin. When that happens, the ball barely comes off the racket - and so it is easy to keep the ball short. Those who have difficulty serving short with spin are having trouble mostly because they are not grazing the ball finely enough - and so the solution isn't to serve with less spin; it's to serve with more spin by grazing the ball more."

What are some common problems that can damage a roof?,"According to the context, some common problems that can damage a roof include:

1. Sun damage (deterioration due to UV rays)
2. Snow and ice accumulation
3. Poorly ventilated attic (leading to excessive heat or cold)
4. Lack of roof maintenance
5. Minor leaks (which can lead to more significant damage if left untreated)

Note that the context does not provide an exhaustive list, but rather highlights some specific issues mentioned in the article.","Here are some common problems that can damage a roof:

1. **Leaks**: Water leaks can cause significant damage to a roof, leading to rot, mold, and mildew. Leaks can occur due to damaged or missing shingles, curled or buckled shingles, or loose flashing.
2. **High Winds**: Strong winds can cause roof damage, especially during hurricanes, tornadoes, or storms with high gusts. Roofing materials like shingles, tiles, or metal can be blown off or damaged.
3. **Ice Dams**: Ice dams form when snow melts and then refreezes on the roof, causing water to back up under the shingles. This can lead to leaks and damage.
4. **Tree Branches**: Tree branches that are too close to the roof can cause damage during strong winds or storms, knocking off shingles or other roofing materials.
5. **Flashing Issues**: Flashing is the material used to seal gaps around chimneys, vents, skylights, and other roof penetrations. Damaged or missing flashing can allow water to enter the roof and cause damage.
6. **Granule Loss**: Over time, shingles can lose their granules, which helps protect them from the sun's UV rays. When granules are lost, shingles become more susceptible to damage and leaks.
7. **Settling Foundation**: A settling foundation can cause a roof to shift or sag, leading to uneven shingle installation and increased risk of leaks and damage.
8. **Pest Infestation**: Pests like rodents, squirrels, or birds can nest in the attic or walls, causing damage to insulation, drywall, and other roofing materials.
9. **Roofing Material Degradation**: Over time, roofing materials like shingles, tiles, or metal can degrade due to weathering, UV exposure, or chemical reactions with other substances on the roof.
10. **Poor Installation**: Improper installation of a new roof can lead to issues like uneven shingle alignment, inadequate flashing, and poor ventilation.

Regular maintenance and inspections can help identify these problems early on, reducing the risk of costly repairs down the line.","10 of the Most Common Problems You May Encounter with Your Roof

---

Here are 10 of the most frequent issues that you may come across with your roof:

---

It isn’t at all uncommon for your roof to experience damage, but urn into a huge problem if it is left untreated. It can be just a minor leak, and it can create a lot of damage, especially to the interior of your home, such as ruined ceilings, wallboard and insulation. Therefore, it is very important that you take the time out of your day to regularly inspect your roof. This helps to detect minor issues long before they develop into major problems that require costly repairs. Here are 10 of the most

---

Problem #1: The Sun.
Over time, the UV rays from the sun can result in the deterioration of your roof. This is particularly true if you have an asphalt singled roof. The asphalt shingles can dry, blister and crack, eventually coming loose and possibly falling off. If this happens, the sheathing underneath will be exposed – as will the roof – to the various weather elements.
Problem #2: Snow and Ice.

---

Problem #9: Poorly Ventilated Attic.
Your roof’s lifespan can quickly be shortened if your attic is not insulated properly. When your attic gets too hot over the summer months, the roof’s shingles “bake” from underneath. This causes them to dry out and become brittle. If the attic is too hot during the winter months, then the snow will melt at a fast pace and the water will refreeze. This continues repeatedly and causes the shingles and flashing to lift continuously.
Problem #10: Lack of Roof Maintenance."
What was the reason for Gwendolyn Cuff's lawsuit against International Business Machine Company (IBM)?,"Gwendolyn Cuff sued IBM for allegedly being discharged from her job in order to deprive her of employee benefits under section 510 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), due to a medical condition (chronic Epstein-Barr Virus) that caused her to be temporarily disabled and absent from work.","I couldn't find any information on a person named Gwendolyn Cuff and her lawsuit against IBM.

16. Ms. Cuff returned to work in early January 1989. In a letter to Dr. Silverberg dated January 6, 1989, Dr. Lane stated that Ms. Cuff had ""recovered from her outbreak of EBV problems"" and that she ""has had an extensive immunologic work-up done, which, thus far, has shown normal results."" Dr. Lane also advised against plaintiff performing any heavy manual labor or working overtime.

He also submitted a medical certificate to IBM's medical department identifying Epstein-Barr Virus as Ms. Cuff's illness.

11. Plaintiff's condition did not improve. In September 1988, Ms. Cuff informed her supervisor, Ms. Donna Jennings, that she was ill. Plaintiff missed work from September 20 to September 23, 1988, and from September 29, 1988 to January 2, 1989. During this time, she was hospitalized for four days in November.

Who inspired the Farmer family to consider adoption from China?,"According to the context, it was Steven Curtis Chapman's concert that inspired Donnie's heart to get information on adopting from China.","I don't have information on a specific Farmer family who adopted from China.

Welcome to our blog ""The Thread to Mylee""! Let me start by telling you a little bit about how we ventured into this journey called adoption. My name is Gina Farmer and my husband is Donnie. We have 3 biological children; Whitney (22), Dillon (14) and Peyton (11), and an adopted daughter from China, Maci (2).

---

But how could we afford this? We knew that if God had spoke to our hearts to adopt, He would take care of the financial end of it. Philippians 4:19 says ""And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus."" We adopted our beautiful daughter, Maci Marie JiaoLe Farmer on Christmas Day 2006! She has been such a blessing to our family and has brought us nothing but pure joy! We thank God for little Maci each and every day!

---

We actually got the idea to adopt from China by attending a Steven Curtis Chapman concert. During the concert, God was really working on Donnies heart. During intermission he told me he was going to get some information on adopting from China. I was totally taken by surprise, but overwhelmed with joy!

---

But God wasn't finished there! He spoke to me and Donnie yet again. So with great faith and little hesitation, we have started the paperwork to adopt another little girl from China. We will name her Mylee.

---

Even before my husband and I got married we knew that we wanted to adopt. We got married in 1995. We were busy enjoying our life together and were in no rush to start a family. When we did decide to start a family, we thought that we would start our family the “easy way” first. We soon discovered that I could not get pregnant.
Looking back, I feel like the desire that both of us shared to adopt was God’s way of leading us to his ultimate gift of our JJ (John Junior).

What is the consequence of a DUI in terms of car insurance according to Nevada laws?,"Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the consequences of a DUI (Driving Under the Influence) in terms of car insurance according to Nevada laws. The context appears to be discussing general information about auto insurance quotes, coverage, and rates in Nevada, without specifically addressing DUI-related issues.","In Nevada, the consequences of a DUI (Driving Under the Influence) on car insurance can be significant. Here are some potential consequences:

1. **Increased premiums**: A DUI conviction can lead to higher car insurance rates for up to 5 years after the offense. The exact rate increase will depend on various factors, including your age, driving history, and the severity of the offense.
2. **Rate hikes**: Insurance companies in Nevada often use a rating system that considers the number of points assessed against you. A DUI conviction can result in a significant increase in your insurance premium, potentially doubling or tripling it.
3. **Suspension or cancellation of coverage**: In some cases, an insurance company may suspend or cancel your policy if you're convicted of DUI. This is more likely to happen if you have a history of accidents, claims, or policy lapses.
4. **Insurance surcharge**: Nevada law requires drivers with a DUI conviction to pay an insurance surcharge, which can range from $50 to $500 per year, depending on the severity of the offense and your age at the time of the incident.

It's essential to note that each insurance company in Nevada may have its own rules and regulations regarding DUI convictions. Some companies might be more lenient than others, while some might impose stricter penalties.

To minimize the impact of a DUI conviction on your car insurance rates:

1. **Shop around**: Compare quotes from multiple insurance providers to find the best rate for your situation.
2. **Consider a specialized insurer**: Some insurers specialize in high-risk drivers and may offer more competitive rates than traditional carriers.
3. **Ask about discounts**: Look into available discounts, such as good student or defensive driving courses, which might help reduce your premiums.
4. **Seek professional advice**: Consult with an independent insurance agent or broker who can provide personalized guidance and help you navigate the process.

Remember, a DUI conviction is not the only factor that determines your car insurance rates. Other factors, like your driving history, age, credit score, and claims history, also play a significant role in determining your premium.","Is not yet disclosed, but which has been having some cover for prized possessions exposed by losses caused by actions nevada car insurance laws Type of california affordable auto insurance quotes You can also freeze your account, you're confirming that you have with me Ensure that everything is current A high-risk or who lose their money.The event of accidental death and dismemberment (ad&d), and business needs To hurt a few of the burden of impending cancellations Reputable insurance companies and

What are the controls for the game Stellar Interface?,"There is no context provided for the question about ""Stellar Interface"". The text only discusses the game Fallout 4 VR, specifically its controls and tracking features using WMR motion controllers. It does not mention any game called ""Stellar Interface"".","I couldn't find any information on a game called ""Stellar Interface."" It's possible that it's a lesser-known or older game, or it may not exist at all.

If you could provide more context or details about the game, such as its genre, developer, or release date, I may be able to help you better. Alternatively, if you're looking for general controls for space-themed games, I can try to provide some common control schemes that are often used in this genre.

For example, some common controls for space-themed games include:

* Movement: W, A, S, D keys (or arrow keys), or left stick on a controller
* Camera movement: Left mouse button (or joystick) to rotate the camera, and right mouse button (or joystick) to zoom in/out
* Actions: Space bar to activate engines, or mouse buttons 1 and 2 for firing weapons
* Inventory management: E key to open inventory menu, or F key to switch between items

Other than the movement speed issue that can be mostly fixed and the occasional direction changes, controls are on an even playing field with the Vive. All buttons from the Vive's setup have an intuitive spot on the WMR motion controllers, and the angle at which you hold the controller to aim down the sight of your gun feels just as natural.

I don’t know who designed such a forceful effects then only change to square mode. Just ok fancy app. Better than stupid iMovie app which is good for nothing complex confusing app in which one cant even no where file is what happening to it where is that going.

---

Because smooth movement — the type that's best suited for immersion — requires constant contact with the touchpad, you'll quickly notice how it's not as responsive on WMR as it is on Vive. It seems like it will occasionally send you off in a direction you didn't want to go, and you'll have to remove your thumb and let if figure itself not. This could have to do with moisture on the hands during long periods of play."
What are some steps the NCUA has taken to encourage federally chartered credit unions?,"The context does not mention any specific steps taken by the NCUA to encourage federally chartered credit unions to offer ""payday alternative loans."" It only mentions that the NCUA has taken steps to encourage these loans, but it doesn't provide details on what those steps are.","The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) has taken several steps to encourage federally chartered credit unions:

1. Increased access to capital: The NCUA provides financing options for credit unions, such as the Corporate Credit Union System and the CU Direct Loan Program, which allow credit unions to borrow money from other federal credit unions.
2. Regulatory relief: The NCUA has implemented various regulatory reforms to reduce compliance burdens on credit unions, such as the ""One-Size-Fits-All"" rule, which reduces the complexity of regulatory requirements for small credit unions.
3. Simplification of operations: The NCUA has simplified some regulatory requirements, such as the reduction of the number of required examinations for federally insured credit unions with assets under $250 million.
4. Support for community development: The NCUA has programs that support credit union development in underserved communities, such as the Credit Union Development Center (CUDC) and the National Credit Union Foundation (NCUF).
5. Enhancements to technology: The NCUA has invested in modernizing credit union technology systems, including online platforms for member access and lending, which helps to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
6. Regulatory flexibility for credit unions serving rural areas: The NCUA provides regulatory relief to credit unions operating in rural areas, allowing them to have more flexible operations and lending standards.
7. Support for new credit union formation: The NCUA has programs that support the formation of new credit unions, such as the National Credit Union Foundation's (NCUF) Start-Up Fund and the CUDC's New Market Credit Union Program.

These initiatives aim to promote economic growth, financial inclusion, and stability in the credit union system.","The NCUA has taken some steps to encourage federally chartered credit unions to offer “payday alternative loans,” which generally have a longer term than traditional payday products.

I was going to go Pro, but I checked your links. It's looking like Pro would be way over my head as a novice. I'm now inclined (but still waiting for others to weight in) to go with Elements. One thing that helped tip the scales (although someone may say that it's irrelevant) is that the videos for Elements seem to compose a detailed course. whereas the videos for Pro seem to be excerpts (serving as ads?) for other sites.

Who is the head coach of Scio High's football team and what is his record?,Kyle Braa is the head coach of Scio High's football team. His overall record as head coach is 78-16.,I cannot verify who the current head coach of Scio High School's football team is or what their record is.,"SCIO — By tapping into the program’s traditional identity, Kyle Braa has transformed Scio High into a perennial football contender.
Braa, in his eighth season as head coach, is 78-16 overall with six league championships (two Tri-River Conference, four PacWest Conference) and a pair of 2A state titles. A prolific rushing attack coupled with a physical defense were the hallmarks of each team.

---

Braa’s initial stint as head coach lasted from 2007-10. The Loggers went 14-9 during his first two years before rattling off consecutive 14-0 records en route to the 2009 and 2010 2A state titles.
After walking away to focus on family and graduate school, Braa returned to the helm prior to the 2014 season. Jim Mask, Scio’s current athletic director, went 28-8 in Braa’s stead.

---

“It’s about all of my coaches,” said Braa, a 2001 Scio graduate who went on to play at Western Oregon. “We are all on the same page, we have the same vision and we know how we want to do things. It’s kind of a brotherhood here and we just understand the vision of Scio sports.”
The majority of Braa’s staff is comprised of fellow Scio alumni.

---

Assistant coaches Casey Childress and Jon Rounsavell graduated with Braa in 2001 while Matt Parazoo (class of 1994), Sam Gray (1997), Mike Ferguson (1999), Justin Guest (2011) and Harley Stephenson (2013) also attended Scio. Chad Peck and Will Baldwin have become adopted Loggers.

---

Scio got off to a 6-0 start last fall and was poised for another deep playoff run before several injuries crippled its chances. The Loggers limped into the round of 16 and were routed by Cascade Christian, 49-0, to end the season.
The Challengers ran through the battered Loggers while quarterback Haiden Schaan, a two-time Southern Cascade League offensive player of the year, was effective in the passing game."

Final Thoughts
Pier Solar and the Great Architects is a good RPG that has a very fun battle system but a harder than usual dungeon exploration setting due to its level design and some cryptic progression choices. The ability to switch from 16-bits to HD modes for both the soundtrack and the graphics is a very nice feature that will definitely please RPG gamers.
Also, do keep in mind that this game is Cross-Buy between the PS3 and PS4 versions, and that a Vita version is coming soon!

One of the strengths of Pier Solar and the Great Architects is how well the visual and game engines are done. The soundtrack is pretty good, and can be switched from 16-bits or remastered on-the-fly (I preferred the charm of the remastered one though!). Same goes for the rendering modes, which can be switched from 16-bit to HD and HD+. I preferred the HD modes, but like I mentioned earlier, the level design has a lot of hidden paths that appeared almost invisible on the HD mode. Because of this, I often"

Whitaker conveys such an excellent sense of charm and madness that you never really know what his character will do. Needless to say Whitaker is

What is the Ask Questions command in PowerPivot in Excel 2010?,"The context does not provide enough information about the Ask Questions command in PowerPivot in Excel 2010.

This feature was introduced as part of the PowerPivot add-in for Excel 2007 and later updates.

To use Ask Questions in PowerPivot, follow these steps:

3. Right-click on the field or table and select ""Ask Questions"".
4. In the ""Ask Questions"" dialog box, enter a list of values that represent the different scenarios or questions that you want to ask.

The Ask Questions feature is useful when you need to create a dynamic data model that can be adapted to changing business requirements. By defining the rules for which data sources to use, you can ensure that your data model remains flexible and relevant.

Why do builders construct residential apartments more than any other type of construction?,"Builders construct residential apartments more because of the high demand and easy approval of home loans for these types of constructions, making them a more attractive option for potential buyers.","Builders construct residential apartments more frequently than other types of construction for several reasons:

1. High Demand: The demand for housing is consistently high, and apartment buildings are often the most affordable and efficient way to provide accommodation for a large number of people.
2. Rental Income: Apartments can generate significant rental income, making them an attractive option for investors and developers.
3. Density: Apartment buildings allow for higher density development, which can lead to more efficient use of land and resources.
4. Scalability: Apartment construction can be scaled up or down depending on market demand, making it a versatile and flexible option for builders.
5. Cost-Effectiveness: Building apartments is often less expensive than constructing single-family homes, as it requires fewer materials and labor hours.
6. Government Incentives: Many governments offer incentives and subsidies to encourage apartment construction, such as tax breaks or density bonuses.
7. Market Trends: The trend towards urbanization and denser living arrangements has led to an increase in demand for apartments, making them a popular choice for builders.
8. Economic Viability: Apartment construction is often more economically viable than other types of construction, as it can generate revenue through rental income and reduce capital costs compared to single-family homes.

Overall, the combination of high demand, cost-effectiveness, and government incentives has made apartment construction a staple of the building industry for builders.","- Malls and shops.
Amongst these, the most popular constructions are the residential apartments. Everyone desires to have a personal property, but few can own a big house. However, apartments are way more affordable. That is the reason, why there is always a demand for residential apartments.
Builders construct residential apartments more:

Due to this increased demand of the residential apartments, the builders make these residential apartments more than any other type of construction. Besides, home loans are easily approved for the residential apartments. Hence, the buyers are keener to buy these over the other types of real estate options.

Builders and small scale real estate businessmen, therefore, are continuously coming up with new projects and ideas for the potential buyers. These construction choices are many in number. The most common construction projects include –
- Residential apartments
- Bungalows and condos
- Commercial buildings

Along with these two important and basic factors, it is also important that you start the project in a well-developed or developing place, so that it is easier for you to sell the residential apartments for a profitable price.

What was the major consequence of the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment?,"The major consequences of the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment include potential lawsuits, Hollywood backlash, damage to its reputation, and exposure of confidential business information, employee data, and sensitive contracts.","In 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a significant cyber-attack, which led to the release of highly classified and sensitive information. The attack was attributed to North Korea and is believed to have been carried out by the group known as the ""Guardians of Peace."" The consequences of the attack included:

1. Release of stolen data: The attackers released approximately 100 GB of data, including emails, documents, and other confidential materials.
2. Movie scripts leaked: The hackers released unedited movie scripts for upcoming Sony films, including ""The Interview,"" which was a comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The release of the script led to the cancellation of the film's premiere in South Korea.
3. Employee data compromised: Personal data of Sony employees, including their social security numbers and addresses, were also released.

The attack had significant consequences for Sony Pictures Entertainment, both financially and reputationally. It is estimated that the company suffered around $35 million in losses due to the cyber-attack. The incident also raised concerns about cybersecurity and the need for better measures to protect against such attacks.

It's worth noting that the US government later blamed North Korea for the attack and imposed sanctions on several individuals and entities linked to the country.","The consequences for Sony have been swift and devastating since the public attack, exposing the media company to potential lawsuits and Hollywood backlash.

North Korea suspected in vicious cyber attacks
Let the hacking commence.
Last month’s crippling cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment revealed confidential information of business practices, employee pay disparities and personal data, unpublished scripts, sensitive contracts, and ugly personal feuds between actors and executives. Experts say these secrets could damage the Hollywood studio for years to come.

---

Although an unknown hacking group calling themselves the “Guardians of Peace” has taken partial credit for the major cyber-leak, the FBI is yet to determine the culprit,
Rather than focusing on traditional targets of cyber-intrusions, such as credit cards, those behind the attack chose to use sensitive information as a weapon of vengeance for Sony’s supposed misdeeds.

---

The hacking into one of Hollywood’s biggest studios has alarmed US officials and cyber security experts, who say this is the first major attack on a US company to use malicious software designed to “incapacitate” computer networks.
“This is a step beyond what they’ve done in the past, but it’s a logical trajectory for them,” said James Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

---

FBI officials and investigators are also determining whether the cyber-attack is linked to North Korea, a reclusive nation with an increasingly potent hacking capability. Sources say the hack may have occurred in retaliation for Sony’s upcoming Christmas release, The Interview, a comedy built around a fictional CIA plot to kill North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, who is revered in the nation. North Koreans have repeatedly denounced the film, warning of “stern” and “merciless” retaliation, but the"

4. Expenses incurred in furthering extramarital affairs","In the context of community property law, which applies to marriages in some states (primarily California, Arizona, Texas, and Louisiana), certain expenditures can be considered ""community waste"" if they are not authorized or approved by both spouses. Here are some examples of expenditures that have been found to constitute community waste:

1. **Unapproved purchases**: Buying something without the other spouse's knowledge or consent, such as a new computer or electronics without discussing it with your partner.
2. **High-interest debt**: Accumulating high-interest debt, like credit card balances, without the other spouse's approval or knowledge.
3. **Luxury items**: Purchasing luxury items, such as designer clothing, jewelry, or exotic vacations, without discussing them with your partner.
4. **Business expenses without consent**: Incurring business expenses related to a side hustle or separate venture without the other spouse's knowledge or consent.
5. **Travel expenses without disclosure**: Taking trips or making travel arrangements without disclosing them to your partner or failing to provide receipts or records of expenses.
6. **Unnecessary renovations**: Making significant home renovations or improvements without discussing them with your partner or obtaining their approval.
7. **High-risk investments**: Investing in high-risk assets, such as cryptocurrency or speculative ventures, without the other spouse's knowledge or consent.
8. **Secret credit card accounts**: Opening secret credit card accounts or using credit cards for personal expenses without disclosing them to your partner.

It's essential to note that community property laws vary by state, and not all states recognize community waste in the same way. Additionally, some expenditures may be considered ""community waste"" only if they were made without the other spouse's knowledge, consent, or disclosure.

To avoid any potential issues, it's always a good idea to:

* Discuss financial decisions with your partner
* Obtain each other's approval for significant purchases or expenses
* Keep records of all financial transactions and receipts
* Be transparent about income, expenses, and financial situations

If you're unsure about specific expenditures or have concerns about community property law in your marriage, consult with an attorney specializing in family law or community property issues.","In an article published in the Journal of the Academy of Matrimonial Attorneys, the author observes that the following expenditures by one spouse, without the permission of the other spouse, have been found to constitute community waste: (1) gambling; (2) a failure to make mortgage or tax payments resulting in a foreclosure; (3) alcohol- and drug-related expenses; and (4) expenses incurred in furthering extramarital affairs.

---

The husband denied community waste and testified that some of the expenditures in question were from taking clients to lunch, business travel, buying a present for his wife and his wife's Lasik surgery. He produced evidence that at least some of the charges were business expenses and that several of the checks in question were written to-and cashed by-his wife.

---

Waste of community property may result in jointly owned community property not being divided evenly by an Arizona court upon a marital dissolution.

---

A good example of an Arizona case where waste was found is Gutierrez v. Gutierrez. There, the husband withdrew approximately $62,000 from the community retirement account without his wife's knowledge and was unable to explain how he had spent such a large sum of money. What was clear was that the expenditures were excessive, abnormal and did not benefit the community.
The Gazeley case

---

Since Arizona is a community property state, property acquired during a marriage is generally deemed to be jointly owned by both parties and, upon divorce, is to be divided evenly. Exceptions do exist. In dividing marital assets and debts, courts can give consideration to excessive or abnormal expenditures by one spouse that amount to squandering jointly held property. The squandering of assets by a spouse, which is referred to as waste, may mean that the spouse committing waste will be allocated less"

What is the origin of the dish Clams Casino?,The Clams Casino originated in Rhode Island.,"Clams Casino is a popular appetizer or side dish that consists of clams topped with breadcrumbs, butter, and seasonings. The origins of this dish are not well-documented, but it is believed to have originated in New England, particularly in the coastal regions of Massachusetts and Maine.

One possible origin story dates back to the early 20th century, when a chef at the popular Newport, Rhode Island restaurant, the White Horse Tavern, created a version of the dish as an appetizer for wealthy guests. The recipe, known as ""Clams Casino,"" was allegedly created by the tavern's chef in the 1920s or 1930s.

According to legend, the chef would top freshly steamed clams with breadcrumbs and butter, then serve them hot, often accompanied by lemon wedges and cocktail sauce. This simple yet elegant dish quickly gained popularity among locals and eventually spread throughout the region.

The name ""Clams Casino"" was allegedly coined because the dish was served in a small, shallow dish or pan, much like a casino game where players bet on the outcome. The term ""casino"" was likely used to evoke the idea of a high-stakes meal that was both elegant and indulgent.

While this origin story may be apocryphal, it is widely recognized as one of the most plausible explanations for the creation of Clams Casino. Over time, the dish has evolved, with various recipes and variations emerging across the United States and beyond. Nevertheless, its origins remain tied to the rich culinary heritage of New England's coastal communities.","CHICOPEE, Mass. (Mass Appeal) – Clams casino is a clam “on the halfshell” dish that originated in Rhode Island. Personal Chef Bill Collins from ChefBill.com, showed us how to make this delicious seafood dish.
Clams Casino
Ingredients:
18 medium (2 1/2-inch) littleneck (or other) clams, scrubbed clean
2 ounces pancetta or bacon
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup finely diced red pepper
2 medium shallot, peeled and finely chopped
2 large garlic cloves, minced
½ teaspoon dried oregano
1/3 cup dry white wine

---

Remove the skillet from the heat and cool completely. Stir the chopped pancetta and 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese into the vegetable mixture. Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and pepper.
Line a heavy large baking sheet with foil. Remove the top shell from the clams, and carefully separate the clam from the bottom shell, with a clam or paring knife. Arrange the clams on the baking sheet.

---

1/3 cup dry white wine
4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Lots of kosher salt
Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450º
In a large pot over a high heat, place the clams in one cup of water. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook the clams just until they start to open, 4-6 minutes. Remove from the pot and discard any clams that do not open.

---

Spoon the vegetable mixture atop the clams, dividing equally and mounding slightly. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan.
Bake until the clams are just cooked through and the topping is golden, about 10 minutes.
NOTE: If the clams won’t sit steadily on sheet pan for baking in the oven, spread a thick layer of kosher salt in the pan to stabilize the clams while cooking.

Fictional blogs can be some of the most creative and extensive blogs you’ll ever see. They can also be very bare bones and text-heavy. It depends on the blogger and the platform.

Not all blogs are real.
That is, they don’t cover real events happening to real people in the real world. They are actual blogs. They’re just fictional. They cover the events in lives of fictional characters in imaginary worlds that can (but often don’t) resemble the real world.

"What is the common meaning of the phrase ""Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί"" as used in various instances in the Bible?","The common meaning of the phrase ""Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί"" (τี่ εμοι και σοι) is essentially a rhetorical question asking ""What have I done to you that you are causing me trouble?"" or ""Why are you trying to bring disaster on me? Did I wrong you?"" It's an expression of innocence and surprise at being affected by someone else's actions, often in a situation where the speaker feels they have done nothing wrong.","The phrase ""Τί ἐmoὶ καὶ σοί"" (Ti emoia kai soi) is a Greek phrase that appears in several instances in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul and Peter. It is often translated to English as ""What have I gained by it?"" or ""What have I won from it?""

In its original context, the phrase is used to express the idea of having been robbed or deceived by someone's actions or behavior. The word ""emos"" (ἔμοις) means ""myself,"" and ""soi"" (σοί) means ""you."" When Paul uses this phrase in his letters to the Corinthians, for example, he is saying that he has not gained anything from being persecuted by the Corinthian church.

In general, the phrase ""Τί ἐmoὶ καὶ σοί"" is used to convey a sense of disappointment, frustration, or disillusionment with someone's actions. It implies that the speaker feels they have been deceived, harmed, or cheated in some way.

Here are some specific examples from the Bible:

* 2 Corinthians 11:7-9: Paul says he has ""become all things to all men so that I might win some of them"" (NIV), and then adds, ""But what have I gained if the Spirit of God with him is crushed? For Christ's love conformed to death.""
* Philippians 3:7-8: Paul writes, ""But whatever gain I may have in anything toward Christ, these I count as loss for the sake of Christ... What then have I that I have gained by it all?"" (ESV)
* 1 Peter 5:12: Peter says, ""So be subject to governors appointed over you, and do what they say. For this is for your good"" (NIV), and then adds, ""What gain had the rulers except to gather a share of power?""

Overall, the phrase ""Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί"" is used to express a sense of disappointment or disillusionment with someone's actions, particularly in the context of spiritual leaders or those in positions of authority.","In John 2:4, Jesus responds to His mother Mary with the question, Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί, γύναι; This has been widely misunderstood either as a harsh rebuke or as questioning the relevance or propriety of Jesus involving himself with the problem of the wine running out. But let’s survey the other instances of the phrase in the Bible.
Judges 11:13 – “ Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question: “What do you have against me – Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί (LXX) – that you have attacked my country?”

---

But Jesus’ statement refers most (Τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί;). In both texts the narrative reveals a reluctant prophet who is called upon to provide for one in need, a need the prophet sees as an unwanted involvement.
In all these passages the complaint is, “What have I done to you that you are causing me trouble unjustly? Why are you trying to bring disaster on me? Did I wrong you?” Or even, in Hebrew, Ma li valach, “What do you have against me?”

Employment opportunities
What is the college doing to help its student in being successful for employment? Students should be helped in identifying the available employment opportunities. Employers should also be invited to schools to assist the students in preparing and conducting interviews. A good college should be concerned with the success of its students when it comes to employment.

There it is. A memory. An artefact to hoard and cherish. Not to be launched into the attic dust but carefully stored within the mind as experience. We all hoard experiences. You really cannot throw them away, even if desperate to do so. You’d have to throw yourself away. And of course, that’s been done, many times over, always with the same, sad ending.

What are the top challenges organizations face when achieving their mobility goals according to the surveys?,"According to the context, the top three challenges organizations face when achieving their mobility goals are:

1. Security concerns (67%)
2. Determining ROI (32%)
3. A lack of funds (29%)","Based on various surveys and studies, some of the top challenges organizations face when achieving their mobility goals include:

1. **Security concerns**: Many organizations struggle with securing mobile devices and data, particularly in industries where security is a critical concern (e.g., finance, healthcare).
2. **Compliance and regulatory issues**: Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, such as HIPAA for healthcare or PCI-DSS for financial institutions, can be a significant challenge when implementing mobility solutions.
3. **Data management and storage**: Managing and storing sensitive data on mobile devices can be a concern, particularly in industries where data is highly regulated (e.g., finance, healthcare).
4. **Device management and support**: Managing the lifecycle of mobile devices, including updates, maintenance, and troubleshooting, can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
5. **User adoption and education**: Encouraging employees to adopt mobile solutions and use them effectively can be a challenge, particularly if users are not tech-savvy or have limited experience with mobile devices.
6. **Cost and ROI**: Justifying the cost of mobility initiatives and demonstrating a clear return on investment (ROI) can be a challenge for organizations.
7. **Network and infrastructure limitations**: Mobile devices can place additional demands on network resources, which can be a challenge in organizations with limited bandwidth or outdated infrastructure.
8. **App development and management**: Developing and managing mobile apps that meet business needs and are compatible across multiple platforms can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
9. **Integration with existing systems**: Integrating mobile solutions with existing systems and applications can be challenging, particularly if there is a lack of standardization or interoperability.
10. **Measuring success and ROI**: Measuring the effectiveness of mobility initiatives and demonstrating a clear ROI can be difficult, making it challenging for organizations to justify future investments.

These challenges are not exhaustive, and the specific pain points may vary depending on the organization's size, industry, and goals. However, by understanding these common challenges, organizations can better prepare themselves for implementing successful mobility solutions.","Apperian research demonstrates that 60% of companies are developing their own mobile apps to support and speed up main business processes. 67% of respondents consider improved business processes as a goal for mobility.
Top challenges
The respondents were asked to name the top challenges to achieving their mobility goals. The results were as follows:
- Security concerns (67 % )
- Determining ROI (32 %)
- A lack of funds (29 %)

---

- A lack of funds (29 %)
- Reaching Bring your own device (BYOD) policy, contracted or unmanaged devices (26%)
- A lack of management tools (23%)
Security
Security tops the list of the challenges that organizations face when they develop their applications. This is due to the constant evolution of mobile security threats. All mobility programs must ensure that they appropriately respond to the security risks.

---

Visibility and Investments
Any enterprise mobility program need to be thoroughly analyzed in order to be successful. According to the Cisco forecast more than 50% of all organizations have no idea whether their apps are used. 48% do understand who is using their applications and 42% can see how frequently apps are run.
All surveyed organizations need greater visibility into statistics about their app usage.
Participants stated the list of investments they are making to increase the adoption:

In the modern mobile world all organizations are beginning to build their own enterprise mobile applications, which makes them turn to specialized mobile application testing services to respond to new challenges and market requirements.

What is the story of Mikol Blake-Green's journey in college basketball?,"The story of Mikol Blake-Green's journey in college basketball is one of overcoming obstacles and personal growth, both on and off the court. Despite facing challenges, he found guidance from his coaches, Coach Jones and Coach Gibson, who helped him develop not only as a player but also as a person. He eventually found comfort and consistency at Fisher College, where he's now thriving despite having to navigate an emotionally difficult transition in the past.","I couldn't find any information on a person named Mikol Blake-Green. It's possible that you may have misspelled their name or that they are not a well-known figure in college basketball.

However, I did find information on Mickaël ""Mikol"" Blake, a French professional basketball player who played for the Dunkerque Dragons and the Strasbourg IG of the LNB Pro A. But I couldn't find any information on his journey in college basketball.

If you could provide more context or clarify which Mikol Blake-Green you are referring to, I'll do my best to help.","It was a heavy burden on a young teenager, but because of his devotion to his mom, it was something that he felt more than obligated to do. “Mikol is a good person with a beautiful heart and a kind soul”, said Veola.
When he eventually graduated from high school following a stellar basketball career, Mikol enrolled at nearby Bunker Hill Community College. Along the way, he would meet two men who would have a great influence on his life on and off the court.

---

Mikol added, “I had never received that sort of guidance before that I got from Coach Jones and Coach Gibson. They both made me a better player and help me apply those lessons on the court to apply to life as well.”
Those lessons would come in handy in regards to the next major event of his life. Along the way at Bunker Hill, his mother would get a job offer in Baltimore. Mikol decided to stay in Massachusetts while also planning on what his next move academically was going to be.

---

Eventually, the school would accept Mikol as a student-athlete. When his playing days are done, he’s hoping to become a coach. In his own way, he’ll be paying back the many people along the way that have helped him.
For the many student-athletes that play collegiate sports, Mikol’s story is all too common. We always hear about the All-Americans or the All-Conference standouts. But for many others, their stories are seldom told or seldom heralded.

---

For Mikol Blake-Green of Fisher College, the season has slowly given him a chance to relax and feel comfortable on and off the court. A native of Boston, the 6-foot-7 forward has been getting consistent minutes for the Falcons, an NAIA independent.
However, the road to this destination has been without its obstacles and pitfalls.

---

Coach Jones added that seeing Mikol make the emotional transition on and off the court was something that he’s the proudest of. “He definitely had a bit of a chip on his shoulder when he arrived here”, he added.
“However, we slowly developed some trust amongst each other along the way. It definitely made our relationship grow as a whole. The biggest thing I tried to impress upon him was building relationships.”"

While there was nothing innovative about the game itself, I thought the art style was unique and interesting. I always looked forward to the bonuses between rounds, and the easy gameplay made it ideal to pull out for quick rounds. If you haven’t tired of the genre, give Friki Tricks a try.

---

Have you heard of the match-three genre? Of course you have. A conservative count puts the number of match three games in the app store at above fifty. As in the other games, with a grid of different pieces in Friki Tricks, you need to move items around to match three of the same icons in a row. This causes those pieces to disappear, and new ones to fall into the playing field. But will there be enough in Friki Tricks to hold your interest in this saturated genre?

I also checked out Grimm Bros Dragon Fin Soup. They recently had a successful kickstarter and as a result, had a playable demo of their game. I saw some of Hotline Miami and that game looks like its going to better than the original. If gamers haven’t played the original, they need to pick it up.

What are some methods to safely and completely remove files/folders from a Linux system?,"There are three main methods:

1. Method A: Manual Removal - Requires manually closing unnecessary processes, backing up important files, and then removing files or directories using tools like ""wipe"" or ""shred"".
2. Method B: Automatic Removal (Quick and Safe) - Uses the Secure-Delete tool with commands like:
   - srm (overwrites file multiple times before removing)
   - smem (removes memory)
   - sfill (fills disk with zeros, then removes)
   - sswap (swaps contents of files to other locations, then removes)
3. Secure-Delete is also available as a set of tools for Linux operating system providing advanced techniques for permanent removal of files.","Here are some methods to safely and completely remove files and folders from a Linux system:

1. **`rm` command**: The `rm` command is used to delete files and directories. To permanently delete a file or directory, use the `-i` option to confirm deletion:
   ```bash
   rm -i /path/to/file_or_directory
   ```
   Alternatively, use `--interactive` option with `sudo` to ask for confirmation before deleting:

   ```bash
   sudo rm --interactive --force /path/to/file_or_directory
   ```

2. **` shred` command**: The `shred` command securely deletes files by overwriting them multiple times with random data:
   ```bash
   shred -u /path/to/file
   ```
3. **`dd` command**: The `dd` command is used to copy or delete files, and can be used to wipe a file system by writing zeros to the disk:
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX1 bs=4096 status=progress || true
   ```
4. **`find` command**: The `find` command is used to search for files and directories, and can be used to delete them recursively:
   ```bash
   find /path/to/dir -type f -delete
   ```
5. **Use a file manager or GUI tool**: Many Linux distributions come with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow you to remove files and folders from the file system.

6.  **`sudo rm -rf` command**: Be cautious when using `sudo rm -rf`. This command will permanently delete all contents of the specified directory tree, including any subdirectories. Use this command only if you're sure you want to delete everything in a given directory:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /path/to/dir
   ```

7.  **Use a secure deletion tool like BleachBit**: BleachBit is a free and open-source utility that securely deletes files and folders by overwriting them with random data.

8.  **`rmdir` command**: The `rmdir` command can be used to remove empty directories:
   ```bash
   rmdir /path/to/dir
   ```

9.  **`traverse` option in the `find` command**: This will find all files and directories recursively, but only delete if they're empty:

    ```bash
     sudo find . -type f -delete -print0 | xargs -0 rm
     ```
    or 
    ```bash
   sudo find /path/to/dir -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \;
   ```

10.  **Be aware of backup and system restore points**: If you're deleting files or directories from a Linux system, make sure to consider the possibility of losing important data if there are no backups available.

These methods ensure that files and folders are completely removed from a Linux system without causing any data loss or corruption issues.","Let’s see how we can safely and completely remove files/folders from our Linux system. The methods mentioned below remove data completely so it becomes very hard for recovery tools to find traces of the actual data and recover it.

shred -n 100 filename
If you want to truncate and remove file after overwriting, use ""shred -u"" option

“srm” command works similarly to “rm” command, but instead of just deleting the file, it first overwrites it multiple times with some random data and then removes the file permanently. The syntax for this command is pretty simply, just specify the file or directory to remove and it will take care of the task.

What are the potential issues if a new fence is not stored properly before processing?,"If a new fence is not stored properly before processing, it can appear in the pipe surface of various problems such as white powder and rust, which will add to later production costs.","If a new fence is not stored properly before processing, several potential issues can arise:

1. **Warpage or bending**: Wooden fences may warp or bend due to moisture absorption, which can affect their structural integrity and appearance.
2. **Rot or decay**: Exposure to moisture can cause the wood to rot or decay, leading to a shorter lifespan for the fence.
3. **Insect infestation**: If the fence is not dried properly, insects like termites or carpenter ants may infest the wood, causing damage and deterioration.
4. **Splintering**: Wooden fences that are not properly seasoned (dried) can splinter easily, especially when exposed to moisture or handling.
5. **Discoloration**: Fences stored in humid environments may discolor or develop uneven staining, which can affect their appearance.
6. **Pest damage**: Pests like mold, mildew, or fungus can grow on the fence if it's not properly dried and stored, leading to further damage.
7. **Fence movement**: If the fence is not properly secured or supported during storage, it may shift or move out of place, causing damage to surrounding structures or landscaping.
8. **Increased risk of fungal growth**: Fungal growth can occur on wood fences if they're not properly dried and stored, which can lead to further decay and structural issues.

To prevent these issues, it's essential to store new fences properly before processing, following guidelines such as:

* Storing them in a dry, well-ventilated area
* Keeping them away from direct sunlight
* Using protective coverings or wraps to prevent damage from insects or pests
* Regularly inspecting the fence for signs of damage or deterioration

By taking these precautions, you can help ensure your new fence remains structurally sound and visually appealing.","The new fence should be kept properly before processing. If handled improperly, will appear in the pipe surface of various problems, if the emergence of white powder, rust, and so on, although after grinding and pickling steps, can be handled, but will add to the later production sector burden, indirectly increased production costs, so the new fence profiles must be good protection measures.

What challenges are faced by farmers in Greenland due to changing weather conditions?,"Farmers in Greenland face several challenges due to changing weather conditions, including:

1. Diminishing prospects for farming due to dry summers.
2. Severe drought striking the country in two out of the past five years.
3. Shorter winters leading to a shorter growing season.
4. Increased temperatures causing crop failures and poor growth in pastures for livestock.
5. Decreased number of sheep farmers, from 74 in 1983 to about 37 farms today.

These challenges are affecting Greenland's agricultural sector, which relies heavily on food imports from Denmark and other European countries due to the country's remote location.","Farmers in Greenland face several challenges due to changing weather conditions, including:

1. **Increased temperatures**: Rising temperatures are altering the growing season and affecting crop yields. This is particularly challenging for farmers who rely on traditional crops such as potatoes and barley.
2. **Shifts in precipitation patterns**: Changes in precipitation patterns are leading to more frequent and severe flooding events, which can damage crops and infrastructure.
3. **Melting permafrost**: Thawing permafrost is causing soil instability, making it difficult for farmers to maintain stable crop yields and increasing the risk of landslides.
4. **Changes in growing season length**: The longer growing season is allowing farmers to plant more crops earlier, but also means that they have less time to harvest before the weather becomes unfavorable again.
5. **Increased pest and disease pressure**: Climate change is altering ecosystems, leading to an increase in pests and diseases that can damage crops.
6. **Reduced pollination**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are affecting the timing of pollination events, which can impact crop yields.
7. **Loss of traditional farming practices**: As climate change alters the environment, traditional farming practices may no longer be effective, leading to a loss of cultural knowledge and expertise.
8. **Increased costs**: Farmers may need to invest in new technologies or infrastructure to adapt to changing weather conditions, which can be costly.
9. **Food insecurity**: Climate change is affecting food availability and quality, particularly for vulnerable communities who rely on traditional crops.
10. **Disruption to livestock production**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are affecting the health and productivity of livestock, leading to reduced milk yields, lower-quality meat, and increased mortality rates.

To address these challenges, farmers in Greenland are exploring innovative solutions such as:

1. **Climate-resilient crop varieties**: Developing new crop varieties that can withstand changing weather conditions.
2. **Irrigation systems**: Implementing irrigation systems to support crops during droughts or periods of low rainfall.
3. **Greenhouse production**: Using greenhouses to extend the growing season and protect crops from extreme weather events.
4. **Integrated pest management**: Developing integrated pest management strategies that incorporate cultural, biological, and chemical controls to minimize pesticide use.
5. **Livestock breed selection**: Selecting livestock breeds that are better adapted to changing environmental conditions.

By adopting these innovative solutions, farmers in Greenland can improve their resilience to climate change and maintain food security for themselves and future generations.","Instead, says Aqalooraq Frederiksen, a third-generation farmer who works at a regional farmer assistance bureau, the dry summers are diminishing the prospects for Greenlandic farming.
Recent summers have been both warm and dry, causing drought in south Greenland, says John Cappelen, a climatologist at Danish Meteorological Institute, which maintains climate data for the island.

---

“This year we also had drought throughout most of the early summer, but limited rainfall late in the summer made the harvest better than last year,” says Egede. But severe drought has struck Greenland in two of the past five years and recently published research suggests the trend may continue because of large scale changes in Arctic weather systems.

---

Since Greenland’s 60,000 citizens rely almost entirely on food imports from Denmark and other European countries, farmers and officials have hoped that steadily rising temperatures, and shorter winters, would spur a growth in agriculture here. (Summer temperatures have risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit in southern Greenland since 1975, increasing the growing season by two weeks.) And media stories about Arctic gardening in greenhouses or the warming temperatures have hyped the possibilities.

---

“In 2015, for example, we didn’t have spring,” said Greenlandic agricultural consultant Henrik Motzfeldt Egede. “It just went from a very cold winter to a hot, dry summer.” He says growth in pastures for livestock was “very bad as a result.” Meanwhile, the number of sheep farmers in Greenland has fallen from 74 in 1983 to about 37 farms today, says Frederiksen.

It’s a cool August morning as I ride in Magnus Hansen’s dented pickup truck through the verdant hills of south Greenland. We’re in search of his flock of 500 sheep grazing on the slopes. Soon we encounter three animals grazing by the gravel on the dirt road. The two ewes and a lamb first eye us warily from the bushes, then scurry across the road. Nearby is a shimmering fjord, but less than 10 miles away, though we can’t see it, lies Greenland’s mighty ice cap, a mile thick in the center of the island."

What was the basic strategy that Uber used to become a successful startup in the transportation industry?,"Uber's basic strategy was to simply take advantage of the existing system, identifying a loophole in the industry and offering a solution. They didn't create something entirely new, but rather adapted and optimized an existing concept, which allowed them to capitalize on the opportunities left by the traditional taxi industry.","Uber's success can be attributed to several key strategies. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. **Network Effect**: Uber's early success was largely due to its network effect. By connecting drivers with passengers, Uber created a self-reinforcing cycle where more users meant more opportunities for both parties. As the network grew, so did the value proposition, making it harder for competitors to catch up.
2. **Low Barriers to Entry**: Uber's business model allowed anyone with a car and a smartphone to become an Uber driver. This low barrier to entry enabled a large pool of potential drivers to join the platform, providing a surplus of supply that kept costs low.
3. **Franchising Model**: By adopting a franchising model, Uber was able to rapidly expand its operations while maintaining control over the core experience. This allowed the company to quickly scale while minimizing risks associated with individual markets.
4. **Data-Driven Operations**: Uber invested heavily in data analytics and machine learning to optimize its operations. By leveraging big data and predictive modeling, Uber could improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance user experiences.
5. **Partnerships and Acquisitions**: Uber strategically partnered with other companies, such as credit card companies and transportation networks, to expand its reach and strengthen its offerings. It also made strategic acquisitions, like Careem in the Middle East and Jump in the US, to accelerate growth.
6. **Focus on User Experience**: Uber prioritized user experience from the early days, investing heavily in app design, customer support, and features that enhanced convenience and safety for both drivers and riders.
7. **Aggressive Growth and Disruption**: Uber was willing to disrupt traditional industries and challenge established players. Its relentless growth and focus on innovation helped it maintain a competitive edge and attract new talent.

By combining these strategies, Uber was able to quickly establish itself as a dominant player in the transportation industry and achieve remarkable success as a startup.","Why Uber became such a massive success?
The wheel is one of the best man-made inventions.
Imagine how our world would have been if we didn’t have realized that it is easier to roll down things than to push or drag them.
The transportation industry was born out of it.
Yes, air and sea travel do not exactly rely on wheels but they still play a vital role.
The transportation industry established a long ago, and it is one of the most successful and blooming industry.

---

A few years back, Uber came up with a simple yet brilliant idea.
Their idea changed the whole transportation industry and today it is “THE” most successful startup.
But how did they reach the spot?
What happened?
Did they sell their soul to the Satan?
If not, will they?
They not only affected the taxi business but there are speculations that they might affect the overall car industry.
How can a small idea change everything?

---

Uber is not a perfect solution by any means.
We keep hearing how taxi drivers have harassed a customer or in some cases, we hear how the customers were overcharged.
But it is certainly a better platform.
You have a place where you can complain.
Today a lot of startups have adapted the same business model and they are doing well.
Maybe the competition will help these industries to overcome their shortcomings.

How many times you didn’t like the way the driver drove you to your destination?

Alice’s Adventures in the House of 1000 Corpses
This is going to be completely unrelated and of hardly any interest to anyone but movie nerds, but it’s been bugging me. It’s my blog after all, so I’ll post whatever I want. Now here is a post about movies.

Another movie which I’ve recently seen (again) is The House of 1000 Corpses, a horror flick shot in 2003 by Rob Zombie. It’s a movie about a bunch of teens who get slaughtered by an insane family of murderers and occultists. Here, the most remarkable character of the film is Captain Spaulding, a creepy deranged clown with rotten teeth, played by Sid Haig.
So: Two movies. One a 2010 kid’s movie, the other an R-rated, gory horror flick. Now I’d like you to take a look at the two character’s make-up:

Of course I know the correct answer is who gives a fuck?, but for some reason, stuff like this really buggs me.
PS: Other people noticed the make-up, too. This one is also a very nice review of Alice: “this movie is a wonder to look at, but a chore to sit through.” Couldn’t have said it any better.

This psalm is one of the most bracing of the imprecatory psalms. In fact, it almost offends our Christian conscience. However, if we understand its prophetic significance, we come to realize that it reveals God’s heart towards the traitor Judas who threw away his birthright, so to speak, for thirty pieces of silver. The psalm displays the proper attitude of the Lord’s Anointed against the spirit of Antichrist that motivated Judas and will fill the man of sin in the last days.

"What is the movie ""Wassup Rockers"" based on?","The movie ""Wassup Rockers"" is partially based on the real lives of its actors.","""Wassup Rockers"" (2006) is a comedy film loosely based on the true story of the ""Horsemen,"" a group of friends who started a rap battle club at their high school in Los Angeles. The movie stars Will Ferrell, Blake Clark, and Adam Scott.

The film's plot revolves around the main characters, who form an underground rap battle club to challenge local gangs and establish their own reputation as rappers. The story is inspired by the real-life experiences of the ""Horsemen"" crew, who started a rap battle club at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles in 1992.

The movie takes creative liberties with the true story, exaggerating some aspects and adding fictional characters to enhance the comedy. Despite these changes, the film's inspiration from the real-life ""Horsemen"" is evident, and it offers a humorous take on the world of rap battles and high school culture.","“Wassup Rockers,” out Friday, follows the antics of Jonathan, Kico, Milton, Porky, Eddie, Louie and Carlos – young Latino skakeboarders from Los Angeles’ South Central ghetto (much like the firsttime actors who play them) who take a trip to posh Beverly Hills, where they’re hassled by cops and picked up by rich white girls.

'The Monster Squad' Is Thirty or Wolfman's Got Mindhole Blowers!

The Monster Squad was released August 14, 1987. The film featured kids running around unsupervised, fighting monsters, saying curse words, and learning what a virgin was. It was peak 80s family fun. I remember watching it quite a few times and then playing Monster Squad with my cousins. We were pretty effing, rad. Duh.

So we went down to Venice to find some skate kids. And there were Porky and Kico; they were 14 or 15. They were really raggedy, their shoes were falling apart and their clothes were much too little for them and they had long hair. But they had style.
We photographed them for four days. A couple months later, when I took the magazine back to them, they wanted to go skating. I ended up taking them skating every Saturday for over a year.
How much of “Wassup Rockers” is real?"
Is it safe to use Diflucan during pregnancy?,"No, according to the provided context, fluconazole (Diflucan) is considered a pregnancy category C medication, meaning it can have teratogenic and embryotoxic effects on the fetus. It's recommended to avoid taking the medication during pregnancy.","Diflucan, also known as fluconazole, is an antifungal medication that can be used during pregnancy in certain situations. However, it's essential to weigh the potential benefits against the risks and consult with a healthcare provider before taking it.

The safety of Diflucan during pregnancy has been studied extensively, and here are some key findings:

1. **First trimester:** The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends avoiding fluconazole in the first trimester due to limited data on its safety in this period.
2. **Second and third trimesters:** Studies have shown that fluconazole is safe to use during pregnancy in the second and third trimesters, with a low risk of adverse effects on the fetus.
3. **Birth defects:** There is no conclusive evidence that fluconazole causes birth defects or miscarriage.
4. **Fetal monitoring:** Fluconazole is generally considered a category C medication, which means it may pose some risks to the fetus, but the benefits may outweigh these risks in certain situations.

When using Diflucan during pregnancy:

1. **Only when necessary:** Use fluconazole only when necessary, such as for severe fungal infections that are not responding to other treatments.
2. **Low doses:** If prescribed, use the lowest effective dose possible to minimize potential side effects.
3. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your blood sugar levels and liver function while taking fluconazole.
4. **Pregnancy testing:** Inform your healthcare provider if you become pregnant or suspect pregnancy.

Potential side effects of Diflucan during pregnancy:

1. **Allergic reactions**
2. **Headache**
3. **Dizziness**
4. **Nausea and vomiting**
5. **Abnormal liver function tests**

In summary, while fluconazole can be used during pregnancy, it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider before taking it, especially in the first trimester. They will weigh the potential benefits against the risks and monitor you for any adverse effects on the fetus or yourself.","150 mg of diflucan safe during pregnancy diflucan costo mexico Being convicted of a drug crime can result in serious and life-altering consequences.Is it safe to take Diflucan during pregnancy?.

What is the central insight of Denis MacEoin's article according to the context?,"The central insight of Denis MacEoin's article is that someone's perception of a situation shapes their reality, implying that perception can be both true and limiting. However, he later argues in his own writing that this idea has become overused and ""gravely dangerous"".","I don't have any information about a specific article by Denis MacEoin. Could you please provide more context or details about the article, such as its title, publication date, or a brief summary? This would help me better understand the topic and provide a more accurate answer.","PS — To reiterate, although perhaps it’s needless, I don’t agree with much else that’s in MacEoin’s paper, certainly not MacEoin’s portrayal of Baha’u’llah, but I do find his central insight to be remarkable. I should note that what I say here doesn’t contradict or override the essential historical point that MacEoin is making, namely, that the Bab was going to the heart of sharia in order to deconstruct and reconstruct it; rather, I’m expanding upon it spiritually and philosophically.

---

Have you read Nader Saiedi’s book, mentioned above? It shows that MacEoin and others had a very big misunderstanding of the Bab’s teachings and laws. And of course, Shoghi Effendi has also clarified the main purpose of the Bab’s legal system in “God Passes By”.
Hi Nicholas, no, although I’ve heard about it from several sources long before this post. But let’s suppose Saiedi is correct and that MacEoin is profoundly wrong about the Babi dispensation: does that negate the essence of my reflection?

---

We do not often think of prophets as jesters. I think ex-Baha’i Denis MacEoin has many unfortunate misconceptions in his article, “Deconstructing and Reconstructing the Shari’a: the Babi and Baha’i Solutions to the Problem of Immutability,” but I feel that in his essential thesis he’s onto something very true and powerful: the Báb joked. I don’t mean that he told funny anecdotes to amuse himself and his companions; I mean his ministry was itself a jest. Here’s what MacEoin says:.

---

that someone’s perception of any given situation shaped their reality. In that sense, the saying is true. BUT, we’ve let things get waaaaay out of hand. In this article, we’ll uncover how the notion, “Perception IS reality,” is gravely dangerous. We’ll dive in to its inherent laziness, and we’ll work to undo the damage caused by its insane overuse.

I was reading an article written by Benjamin P. Hardy, a postgraduate student studying Organizational Psychology, on Medium today when this excerpt caught my attention:.

What are the four categories into which worldwide spending on robots is split?,"The four categories into which worldwide spending on robots is split are:

1. Military
2. Industrial
3. Commercial
4. Personal",I'm unable to provide information on how worldwide spending on robots is categorized.,"BC.
In fact, there’s an interesting graph you should take a look at that splits worldwide spending on robots into four categories: military, industrial, commercial, and personal. In 2015, BCG estimates about $11.0B in spending is for 1.2 million industrial robots, of which 40% (~ $4.4B) are used in automobile factories.

1) Areas of operations with high labor costs – where robot can produce cost savings
2) Tasks that people can’t, won’t, or shouldn’t do – that may lead to injury
3) Human skill gaps – such as real-time analysis, super speed or strength
4) Mission-critical applications – that demand exceptional precision, flexibility, or speed
5) High complexity – of changing supply chains with vast supplier networks

However, robots are moving from manufacturing cars to driving them (think Google). The rest of the industrial segment ($6.6B) and the commercial segment (at $5.9 billion) include a wide range of new applications. Robots are moving into medical, surgical, agricultural, construction, e-commerce fulfillment, and material handling applications.

Today the elementary school had a fundraiser with the local farm stand. This I do participate in. The difficulty is that at this point of the winter they don’t have much local produce so its more like a boutique grocery store. So, I bought apple cider, deli chicken, and flowers.

NEW YORK (CBSMiami) – While more traditional styles of women’s underwear dominate the market, a number of independent brands are catering to a much larger market.
At the New York headquarters of Lively, the unmentionables on display aren’t necessarily meant to be kept under wraps.
“These styles look like you could wear them outside, not just under your clothes,” said Karina Mitchell.
“And they’ve certainly been styled that way,” Alexandra Alquiza responded.

The Post learned that St. Anthony coach Bob Hurley is considering an opportunity to join Hill’s staff, but the timing probably isn’t right.

“At this point I’m looking forward to two more years at St. Anthony,” Hurley said. “I feel I need a number to get me to shut it down and the 900 is out there. Then I think I’d like to try something else in coaching.”
Just the fact that Hill has such a strong relationship with Hurley is great news for Rutgers and bad news for Seton Hall. Seton Hall coach Louis Orr has two years left on his contract, but his status is in limbo.

Former coaches Fran Fraschilla, John Carroll and Pete Gillen could be successors if Orr does not stay. Gillen – who could also wind up at his alma mater, Fairfield – and Quinlan are longtime friends. In an interview early in the season, Quinlan praised Gillen’s work ethic and style, but prefaced it all by saying: “We have a coach.”
Carroll, one of P.J. Carlesimo’s assistants during The Hall’s glory days, coached the Boston Celtics after a stint at Duquesne.

“Who wouldn’t want a legendary coach like Bob Hurley on his bench?” Hill said in the Wachovia Center late Sunday night after watching Villanova beat Arizona, 82-78. “But I’m not the coach at Rutgers and Bob and I haven’t had any discussions along those lines.”
Hurley has 873 wins at St. Anthony and would like to post 900 as a high school coach. He is the most respected prep coach in the Garden State and, should he ever decide to become a college assistant, would be a major coup for any Big East program."

3. Providing a conversation interface for users to chat with their matches.

1. **Limited Accuracy**: Rocket launchers often have a wide spread pattern, making it difficult to accurately target specific enemy positions or individuals.
2. **Recoil and Unstable Platform**: Many rocket launchers are designed to be handheld or mounted on vehicles, which can make them unstable and prone to recoil, making it hard to control the direction of the launched rocket.
3. **Limited Range and Penetration**: While rockets can travel long distances, their penetration power is often limited, especially against soft targets like buildings or infantry. Hardened targets like bunkers or fortifications may be able to withstand even the most powerful rockets.
4. **Explosive Overpressure**: Rockets can create explosive overpressure upon impact, which can damage or destroy the launcher itself and surrounding friendly forces if not used with proper safety precautions.
5. **Vulnerability to Countermeasures**: Modern anti-tank missiles and surface-to-air missiles have developed effective countermeasures against rocket launchers, including jamming signals, decoy systems, and heat-seeking technology.
6. **Resource-Intensive**: Launching multiple rockets in quick succession can deplete the ammunition supply of a launcher, leaving it vulnerable to enemy counterattacks.
7. **Logistical Challenges**: Maintaining and transporting rocket launchers, particularly those requiring specialized support equipment or personnel, can be logistically challenging in combat environments.
8. **Risk of Friendly Fire**: Rocket launchers can cause friendly casualties if not properly identified as friendly forces before engaging the target area.
9. **Environmental Impact**: Improproves rockets can have significant environmental impacts, including noise pollution, collateral damage to civilian infrastructure and potentially harming wildlife populations.
10. **Cost and Weight Limitations**: High-powered rocket launchers often come with substantial weight and cost requirements for production and maintenance.

In summary, the disadvantages of using rocket launchers in combat highlight their limitations as a standalone weapon system and require them to be integrated into larger tactical plans to achieve desired outcomes.","However, despite these massive advantages, Rocket Launchers have equally massive disadvantages. They hurt allies and enemies, which means you will likely not be using Rocket Launchers in combat, and ironically more from a stealth standpoint. They also only have 2 ammo max, so unless you have ways to boost maximum ammo or refill ammo in combat, your Rocket Launcher usage may be short-lived.

Rocket Launchers are also loud, which draws enemies to the source of the noise, though this can be considered an advantage or a disadvantage.

Video: Rocket Launcher - June 10, 2015
Daily posting, this video originally uploaded on November 6, 2014, showing the Rocket Launcher weapon type.
Rocket Launchers are very powerful weapons, dealing 6x damage to a large area at unlimited range. Unlike Rifles, enemies can't protect their friends using Shields, making the Rocket Launcher ideal for taking out groups of enemies at long range.

What is the role of self-endorsement skills in our well-being according to Stren #16?,"According to Stren #16, self-endorsement skills are essential for our well-being because they allow us to assume responsibility and make our life's experience ""joyous and meaningful"". They also benefit our loved ones and serve as a powerful antidote to nonproductive blaming patterns. Self-endorsement helps us override instinctual and traditional problem-solving pathways by adding sufficient emotion to intelligence, empowering our ""freedom organ"" or mature intelligent cerebral cortex portion of the brain.","I couldn't find any information on ""Stren #16"" as it's not a known or recognized source. Could you please provide more context or clarify what you are referring to?

If you meant to ask about the role of self-endorsement skills in our well-being, I can try to help.

Self-endorsement refers to the ability to accept and acknowledge one's own strengths, weaknesses, accomplishments, and feelings. Having strong self-endorsement skills is essential for maintaining good mental health and overall well-being.

People with high self-endorsement skills tend to:

1. Have a positive self-image
2. Feel confident in their abilities
3. Take risks and challenge themselves
4. Are more resilient in the face of adversity
5. Have better relationships with others

On the other hand, individuals with low self-endorsement skills may struggle with feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and self-doubt.

If you have any further questions or would like to know more about self-endorsement skills, please let me know!","Welcome to today’s insight! Stren #16 explains the multiple benefits that place self-endorsement among the most important of all the skills that we require to survive and thrive in today’s world. You will appreciate the series of self-endorsement techniques that follow and will eagerly add them to your collection of wisdoms.

and early-acquired blaming pattern. Blaming becomes habit through repetition during our decades of dependency. Self-endorsement is our opportunity to make a quantum leap towards self-mastery, to become our own person. Self-endorsement skills are the means by which we assume responsibility to make our life’s experience joyous and meaningful. Our skill in self-endorsement serves as a marvelous role model that benefits our loved ones. Self-endorsement is the antidote for the more common nonproductive

Here is the simple explanation of why self-endorsement skills are essential for our well-being. Instinct and tradition hardwire their preferred problem-solving action pathways in the older part of our brain where emotion resides. We create common sense solutions to today’s problems applying new knowledge and wisdom using the last to mature intelligent cerebral cortex portion of our brain, what I label our “freedom organ.” Emotion usually trumps intellect, so self-endorsement is our freedom organ’s powerful

What are some of the potential negative impacts of charity as discussed in the context?,"According to the context, some potential negative impacts of charity include:

1. Not correcting underlying systemic issues: External aid may not address the root causes of problems.
2. Making things worse: Charity can sometimes exacerbate existing issues.
3. Irresponsible and dangerous business practices: Failing to scrutinize supply chains, company culture, and vet charities.
4. Perpetuating charity cases: Creating a world where people are only ""good"" when they receive charity, rather than being treated as sacred beings.

These negative impacts can be avoided by taking steps such as seriously reviewing supply chains, caring about company culture, and vetting charities.","In the context of charity, there are several potential negative impacts that have been discussed. Here are some of them:

1. **Dependence and Entitlement**: Over-reliance on charitable handouts can create a sense of dependence and entitlement among individuals or groups, leading to a lack of motivation to take care of themselves.
2. **Inefficient Allocation of Resources**: Charitable efforts may not always be targeted effectively, with resources being wasted on programs or causes that are not well-designed or implemented.
3. **Cultural Imperialism**: Western charitable organizations and donors may impose their own cultural values and priorities on non-Western societies, potentially disrupting local traditions and ways of life.
4. **Patronizing Attitudes**: Donors or charities may unintentionally patronize the communities they are trying to help, implying that the recipients are unable to take care of themselves or make their own decisions.
5. **Corruption and Mismanagement**: Charities can be vulnerable to corruption, mismanagement, and abuse of funds, which can undermine their effectiveness and erode trust in the charitable sector as a whole.
6. **Power Dynamics**: Charity efforts may perpetuate power imbalances between donors and recipients, with wealthy individuals or organizations holding significant influence over the lives of those being helped.
7. **Unintended Consequences**: Charitable initiatives may have unintended consequences, such as disrupting local economies, creating dependence on handouts, or exacerbating social problems.
8. **Lack of Accountability**: Some charities may not be transparent about their finances, programs, or impact, making it difficult to evaluate their effectiveness and accountability.
9. **Displacement of Local Solutions**: Charitable efforts may displace or undermine local solutions and initiatives, rather than supporting and complementing them.
10. **Exploitation of Vulnerable Groups**: Charities may exploit vulnerable groups, such as those with disabilities, mental health issues, or addiction problems, by perpetuating stigmatizing attitudes or providing inadequate support.

These negative impacts highlight the importance of critically evaluating charitable efforts and ensuring that they are designed and implemented in a way that respects local contexts, promotes sustainability, and prioritizes community empowerment.","Charities, by their nature, go where there is trouble. Uprising, corruption, colonialism, exploitation, bigotry, terror. No amount of external aid, even if given in love and good faith, can correct underlying systemic issues. Sometimes, charity makes things worse.

---

Change happens when marginalized communities are empowered to transform systems of oppression into systems of flourishing.
Social good brands must realize that there are limits to charity, and that building a charitable business model without attention to the ethics of their supply chain or the long term efficacy of the nonprofits they support is both irresponsible and dangerous.

---

Charity is only good now because it is necessary. But the world we should be working toward is one where people are far too important to ever be turned into charity cases, where we don't get to feel good about giving.
Where we get to claim that we're good only when we know that everyone is being treated as the sacred beings they are.
In the words of John Wesley:

---

So, businesses, by all means give to charity. But take it a step further by seriously scrutinizing your supply chain for the slightest sign of injustice and exploitation. Care about company culture. Care about the environment. Vet the charities you support. Treat others the way you'd like to be treated.
I originally covered this topic on my post on One-for-Ones. I'm hoping to do another post distinguishing between charity as a virtue versus ""charity, inc."" soon.

---

You can look at this from a couple of perspectives. On the one hand, it's really nice to know that these hugely profitable enterprises are designating at least some of their profits to charitable giving. It's certainly better than nothing, and for the recipients of these pledges, scholarships, and funds, it can be life changing."
When were gay people given the right to same sex marriage in the UK?,"Gay people were finally given the right to same-sex marriage in the UK on March 29th, 2014.","Gay people in the UK were given the right to same-sex marriage on March 13, 2014, when the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act received Royal Assent. The Act came into effect on March 13, 2014, allowing same-sex couples to marry and have their marriages recognized by law.

However, it's worth noting that the process of achieving same-sex marriage in the UK was not without controversy. The bill passed through Parliament in 2012-2013, with a majority of MPs supporting the legislation. Nevertheless, there were significant debates and discussions during the passage of the bill, and some MPs opposed the change.

Since then, same-sex marriage has been widely recognized and accepted in the UK, with all the major political parties supporting the policy.","Today, March 29th 2014, Gay people are finally given the right to same sex marriage in the UK! None of this civil partnership stuff, we're talking; a full wedding in a church, with a vicar and religious vows marriage – finally!!
I’m thankful that the UK is one of the most accepting and liberal countries in the world, but there is still a lot of judgement, prejudice and sometimes hatred towards homosexual people – It.drives.me.crazy!

I have said to him since, that it drove a small but significant wedge between us for a while, to which he replied that, despite our closeness he was scared his paternal and maternal families would reject him – even in the 21st Century.

As for Paddy Power’s closing question “Were they right to ban us?” I think this recentring of the issue around the hurt feelings of cis privileged people is disingenuous, to say the least and there’s a far more pressing question in my mind. In the voiceover to the advert, Paddy Power state that:

Mary, who was a year older than Everard, was living in Southport and was the daughter of David Connard, a deceased decorator. His eldest sister, Gertrude Oldacre, attended the wedding."

What are some of the elements to consider when designing a patio layout?,"According to the context, some elements to consider when designing a patio layout include:

1. Orientation with the landscape
2. Creating backyard destinations
3. Balcony designs (roof and small)
4. Hardscaping
5. Planting pointers
6. Patio design ideas and inspiration from various sources (e.g. online tools, building ideas, DIY tasks)

Additionally, the context mentions factors such as:

* Size of the patio
* Materials to use (substances mentioned include concrete)
* Style and aesthetic (relaxing, stunning, enjoyable)","When designing a patio layout, there are several elements to consider. Here are some key factors to keep in mind:

1. **Purpose**: Determine how you plan to use your patio. Will it be for dining, relaxation, entertainment, or a combination of these activities?
2. **Size and Shape**: Consider the size of your yard and the amount of space available for a patio. Choose a shape that complements the existing landscape and meets your needs.
3. **Sunlight and Shade**: Assess the amount of sunlight your patio will receive throughout the day. If it's heavily shaded, consider adding solar screens or umbrellas to provide additional shade.
4. **Drainage and Slope**: Ensure that your patio is sloped to prevent water from accumulating and causing erosion or damage.
5. **Material and Color**: Choose a material that complements your home's style and color scheme. Popular options include pavers, concrete, brick, wood, and stone.
6. **Layout Patterns**: Consider the layout pattern of your patio. A simple grid pattern can be effective for smaller spaces, while a more complex design may work better for larger areas.
7. **Furniture and Seating**: Plan where furniture will go on your patio to maximize comfort and flow. Leave enough space between pieces for people to move around easily.
8. **Lighting**: Consider adding outdoor lighting to enhance ambiance and create a welcoming atmosphere in the evening.
9. **Plant Selection**: Choose plants that are heat-tolerant, low-maintenance, and complementary to your patio design.
10. **Functionality**: Incorporate features such as built-in seating areas, fire pits, or water features to enhance functionality and enjoyment of your patio.
11. **Safety**: Consider adding safety elements, such as handrails, non-slip surfaces, or outdoor lighting to prevent accidents and injuries.
12. **Budget**: Establish a budget for materials, labor, and any necessary permits or inspections before starting the design process.

Additionally, consider the following patio design styles:

* Modern: clean lines, minimal ornamentation
* Traditional: classic designs with ornate details
* Rustic: natural materials, rough-hewn textures
* Mediterranean: warm colors, arches, and columns

Remember to also consider your neighborhood's covenants, restrictions (CC&Rs), or homeowners' association (HOA) rules when designing your patio.","Patio designs tips for placement and layout plans for.

"What is the author's perspective on the consumption of pornography, even in moderation?","The author argues that even ""a little"" pornography can be deadly and is poison to one's soul, and therefore, it should not be viewed as harmless or acceptable, even in moderation. They believe that allowing such consumption leads to spiritual death and separates us from God.","The author of "" Porn Land"" (2017), Gershon Khestein, does not provide a straightforward answer to this question as he does not explicitly discuss moderation. However, his book explores the concept of ""porn land,"" which refers to a society that has become increasingly dependent on and obsessed with pornography.

From the perspective of the author, the consumption of pornography can have negative consequences, even in moderation. Khestein argues that the proliferation of pornographic images and videos has created a culture of perpetual arousal, where individuals are constantly bombarded with stimuli designed to activate their sexuality.

The author suggests that this constant exposure can lead to desensitization, making it increasingly difficult for people to experience desire or intimacy in meaningful ways. Additionally, the objectification of women and the perpetuation of patriarchal attitudes towards sex and women's bodies are major concerns.

Khestein also argues that the use of pornography can distort our perceptions of reality, leading to unrealistic expectations about relationships, sex, and intimacy. Furthermore, the consumption of pornography has been linked to various negative outcomes, including increased rates of erectile dysfunction,","Why just a little pornography can be deadly
Written by Kendra White
“A little pornography can actually be a good thing,” I read in horror. A Facebook friend had just posed the question, “Is pornography good or bad?” and the comments were pouring in. “It’s fine as long as you view in moderation,” came the next reply.

---

I couldn’t believe what I was reading. We are talking about pornography, right? The stuff that rips apart marriages, ruins lives, and causes many in the church to give up their pursuit of a holy and righteous God? Pornography- the stuff that is scientifically proven to be bad for your brain and statistically horrible for relationships? Good? You are seriously going to make an argument that it is good?
Isaiah 5:20 says:

---

James 1:14-15 says:
“But each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death” (emphasis added).
Well-Placed Shame
Here’s what I find fascinating though. The person who posed this question openly admitted that they felt shame for viewing pornography. “If it’s not wrong, then why do I feel bad about it?” they wondered.

---

As a culture, we have tolerated the sin of pornography and now its status has moved from “horrible” to “not that bad” to “good in moderation.” This is what happens when we make the mistake of comparing our holiness to that of those around us rather than to that of Christ. We think, “I’m doing better than the next guy,” and all of a sudden that one slip up becomes an addictive temptation that leads to spiritual death.
Scripture gives us a clear warning of the danger of giving into such temptation.

---

Good is being called evil and evil good. We live in a world that has exchanged the truth of God for a lie. The truth is this: even a little pornography is poison to your soul. Pornography is sin, and sin separates us from God (Matthew 5:27-28, James 1:14-15). You wouldn’t tolerate even a little poison in your food, no matter how much was put in! So why do Christians allow themselves to consume something as toxic as pornography?"

When you listen closely, lyrics like “Once upon a time there was light in my life, but now there’s only love in the dark” lend themselves to a more cryptic theme.

Despite its roots, this rock music meaning is widely known as a love song (for mortals).

"What is the difference between a car show, a cruise-in, and a Concours d'Elegance?","A car show, a cruise-in, and a Concours d'Elegance differ as follows:

* A car show: Typically allows any vehicle to be displayed and judged, with minimal requirements.
* A cruise-in: Usually has no minimum requirements to enter your vehicle, but you should check with the event sponsor.
* A Concours d'Elegance: Requires higher-quality original or restored vehicles, often by invitation only, and has stricter judging criteria.","A car show, a cruise-in, and a Concours d'Elegance are all types of automotive events, but they have distinct differences in terms of their purpose, tone, and level of competition.

1. **Car Show**: A general-purpose car show is an event where owners and enthusiasts can display and share their vehicles with others. These events often feature a wide range of vehicles, from classic cars to modern autos, and may include various activities such as:
 * Vehicle displays
 * Automotive vendors
 * Food and drink options
 * Music and entertainment
 * Opportunities for owners to network and socialize with fellow enthusiasts

Car shows are usually informal and relaxed, allowing attendees to come and go at their leisure. They might be held on a weekend day, often in a parking lot or other outdoor space.

2. **Cruise-In**: A cruise-in is a type of car show that focuses on the fun, social aspect of gathering with fellow car enthusiasts. These events typically take place in a public parking lot or street and are designed to foster camaraderie among attendees. Here's what you can expect at a cruise-in:
 * Vehicles are displayed, but owners don't necessarily need to compete for awards
 * A relaxed atmosphere, often with music playing in the background
 * Opportunities for socializing and networking with other car enthusiasts
 * Often accompanied by food vendors, live music, or other entertainment

Cruise-ins tend to be more casual and laid-back than traditional car shows.

3. **Concours d'Elegance**: A Concours d'Elegance (French for ""a competition of elegance"") is a high-end automotive event that focuses on showcasing rare, collectible, or exceptional vehicles in an elegant and sophisticated setting. Here's what sets Concours apart:
 * High-end vehicles are displayed, often with exceptional attention to detail and meticulous care
 * A focus on preserving and promoting the beauty and heritage of classic cars, vintage motorcycles, or other collector items
 * Strict judging criteria, which can include factors like vehicle condition, rarity, historical significance, and overall aesthetic appeal
 * Attendees may be required to dress in formal attire, reflecting the upscale atmosphere

Concours d'Elegance events are typically held on a weekday afternoon or evening, often at prestigious locations such as museums, historic sites, or exclusive private clubs.

In summary:

* Car show: General-purpose event with a wide range of vehicles and activities
* Cruise-in: Social gathering focused on camaraderie among car enthusiasts
* Concours d'Elegance: High-end event showcasing exceptional, rare, or collectible vehicles in an elegant setting

Each type of event caters to different interests and preferences, so it's worth exploring each option to find the one that suits your taste!","A Concours d’Elegance is a little bit different from a car show or a cruise-in, in that you will find a more consistent showing of quality original and restoration vehicles presented for more intense judging. Concours events often require that participants be members of the sponsoring club or organization or that they submit entry paperwork well in advance of the event.

on the planet. If you are thinking of entering a car in one of these events, start by attending a cruise-in or car show before actually entering your car. Experience is the best teacher when it comes to showing your car and winning an award.

---

Questions to Ask:
Which event should I be going to if I am new to the hobby?
You are always encouraged to attend each one as a spectator; however, if you want to enter your car, a cruise-in is probably the best place to show your car for the first time.
Are there minimum requirements to enter my car in these events?
Usually there are no minimum requirements at a cruise-in, but you should check with the event sponsor.
Do I have to belong to a car club to enter a vehicle?

---

Cruise-ins and most car shows do not require that you be a member of a car club to enter your vehicle, but you may encounter shows where some of the judging is limited to club members.
What can I expect at my first time showing a car?

---

One of the best ways to get involved in the collector-car hobby is to attend a local car show or cruise-in. Car shows and cruise-ins are great places to look for a classic or muscle car. Although many car shows do not allow any advertising of cars for sale, owners may be looking for a prospective buyer for a sale in the future, or know of a car similar to theirs that is for sale by another owner. If you do find a car that is available, a car show is a great venue for seeing a prospective purchase in person"
What changes did Toyota make to the Innova over the years to maintain its appeal?,"According to the context, Toyota introduced several minor improvements to the Innova over the years to maintain its appeal. These changes included:

1. Addition of an intercooler (2009)
2. Minor facelift (2011)

These subtle updates helped keep the Innova fresh and competitive in the market for over a decade without requiring drastic changes.","The Toyota Innova has undergone several updates and modifications over the years to maintain its appeal. Here are some of the notable changes made by Toyota:

1. **First Generation (2000-2005)**: The original Innova was launched in 2000 and featured a spacious interior, comfortable ride, and reliable performance. It was designed to compete with other mid-size SUVs in India.

2. **Facelift (2006-2010)**: A facelift introduced new front bumper design, revised taillights, and updated dashboard trim. The Innova's engine options remained the same, but a new 3.4L V6 petrol engine was added as an option for some variants.

3. **Second Generation (2010-2019)**: Introduced in 2010, this generation saw significant updates, including a new front grille design, LED headlights, and a more modern interior with improved infotainment system. The Innova also gained a more efficient diesel engine.

4. **Facelift (2016-2020)**: A facelift introduced new LED headlamps, revised taillights, and updated interior trim materials. The Innova's engine options were tweaked to improve fuel efficiency, with the introduction of a 2.5L VVT-i diesel engine.

5. **Third Generation (2020-present)**: The current-generation Innova was launched in 2020 and features a more aggressive front fascia design, LED headlights, and updated interior trim materials. The Innova also gained new safety features like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and automatic emergency braking.

Key updates that contributed to the Innova's continued appeal include:

* Improved engine efficiency and performance
* Enhanced interior space and comfort
* Advanced infotainment systems with touchscreen displays
* Addition of advanced safety features
* Regular updates to exterior design to stay competitive in the market

By continuously updating and refining its offerings, Toyota has managed to maintain the Innova's position as a top choice in the Indian SUV market.","It’s not an easy decision to take off your best-selling product from the market and replace it with the one that has no parallel. That’s exactly what Toyota did in February 2005 by discontinuing the Qualis multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) and launching a bigger, more luxurious MPV, the Innova.

Launched in February 2005, the Innova was a runaway success, even at then what was a hefty price tag for an MPV—from Rs 6.75 lakh to Rs 10 lakh.

What competitors didn’t quite understand was how could a brand maintain its appeal for over a decade without the manufacturer making too many changes to it. A few improvements Toyota introduced were the addition of an intercooler (2009), a minor facelift (2011), and a second minor

Earlier this month, Toyota launched yet another variant—the Innova Touring Sport from Rs 17.79 lakh to Rs 22.15 lakh.

The Scion iM comes from the side of Toyota that we are not accustomed to seeing.

But instead of the xB’s controversial boxy look and appeal, the iM poses as a conventional hatchback with a factory body kit, a lowered suspension, a polarizing paint job, cool looking wheels, and an interior that looks like it had a bout with an aftermarket tuner shop. This car was clearly

This design has been around since 2012 and staying true to Toyota fashion, it shares the same 1.8-litre 2ZR-FAE engine that has been around since 2009. There is a reason why Toyota builds some of the most reliable products on the market, and that’s because they’ve been refining the same platforms for years on end. Not that it’s a bad thing but I couldn’t help but wonder, would this car be ready to compete in 2016 or would it feel a bit long in the tooth?"

1. **Needs Analysis Technique**: This technique involves identifying and understanding the customer's needs, wants, and problems. The salesperson asks questions to gather information about the customer's requirements and then presents solutions that meet those needs.
2. **Features-Advantages Technique**: In this approach, the salesperson highlights the key features of a product or service and explains how they can benefit the customer. This technique focuses on the product's qualities and how they can solve specific problems or improve the customer's situation.
3. **Storytelling Technique**: This technique involves sharing personal stories, anecdotes, or examples that illustrate the benefits of a product or service. The salesperson uses storytelling to create an emotional connection with the customer and make the sale more memorable.

So getting used to the publishing industry, which often moves at a glacial pace, has really taught me to take deep breaths, calm down, and curb my need for speed. I’ve even tattooed the reminder on myself. ;)
What's next for you?"

Who directed the recent remake of Alice in Wonderland?,"The context does not mention who played the role of the Red Queen, but it does mention that she was played by Helena Bonham Carter. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in your question.","I couldn't find any information on a recent remake of ""Alice in Wonderland"". There have been two major film adaptations of Lewis Carroll's classic tale, however.

The first was the 1951 Disney animated film ""Alice in Wonderland"", which was directed by Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske. 

The second is the 2010 film ""Alice in Wonderland"" directed by Tim Burton, starring Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter.","You may be aware that there has been a recent remake of Alice in Wonderland, directed by Tim Burton, which hit the cinemas last year. I have only recently seen it. The design is incredible, but the kitschy ending somewhat ruined it for me. Anyhow, undoubtedly one of the most memorable parts of the movie is the role of the “Red Queen” aka “Queen of Hearts”. She’s the evil character of the Story, though in a very childlike, vulnerable way.
Now bear with me for a second.

Of course I know the correct answer is who gives a fuck?, but for some reason, stuff like this really buggs me.
PS: Other people noticed the make-up, too. This one is also a very nice review of Alice: “this movie is a wonder to look at, but a chore to sit through.” Couldn’t have said it any better.

Another movie which I’ve recently seen (again) is The House of 1000 Corpses, a horror flick shot in 2003 by Rob Zombie. It’s a movie about a bunch of teens who get slaughtered by an insane family of murderers and occultists. Here, the most remarkable character of the film is Captain Spaulding, a creepy deranged clown with rotten teeth, played by Sid Haig.
So: Two movies. One a 2010 kid’s movie, the other an R-rated, gory horror flick. Now I’d like you to take a look at the two character’s make-up:"

What are the rules of the sumo wrestling match mentioned in the context?,"The rules of the sumo wrestling match are:

1. The first wrestler to make their opponent step outside the ring or touch the ground with anything but his feet wins the bout.
2. No actual fighting is allowed; it's a game of skill and strategy.

Note: There is no mention of rolling, wedgies, topknots, or any other specific elements mentioned in the context.","I don't have specific information on a particular sumo wrestling match. However, I can provide you with general rules and regulations of traditional sumo wrestling.

In traditional sumo wrestling, also known as ""ryu Kyu"", there are two main objectives:

1.  To force your opponent to fall down or touch the ground.
2.  To score points based on your opponent's position in relation to the ring.

Here are some general rules of sumo wrestling:

*   The match starts with both wrestlers facing each other and standing at opposite ends of a circular ring, known as ""dohyo"".
*   On signal from the referee (known as ""gyoji""), both wrestlers rush towards each other.
*   In order to win, one wrestler must push his opponent out of the ring or make them fall down, resulting in a point being awarded to the winner.
*   If both wrestlers reach the center line and touch each other simultaneously, it is considered a stalemate, and no points are awarded.
*   A match can end in several ways:
    *   The winning wrestler stands over his opponent in the ring with one foot inside and one foot outside. This is called ""sekiwake"" (win by pushout).
    *   The winning wrestler stands over his opponent's left shoulder, right hand outstretched, as long as the opponent cannot step forward or backward. This is called ""kotefuki"" (win by pushover).
    *   The winning wrestler can also win by throwing his opponent across the ring.
*   A sumo match consists of six six-man bouts and a total of 15 points are awarded for each bout.

Sumo wrestling has many rules and regulations, but I'd like to note that different tournaments may have slightly varying rules.","We'll book you in for a sumo wrestling match at a venue a short distance from Edinburgh city centre. On arrival, the guys will get you suited up, explain the very simple rules and give the whole stag party a chance to wedgie the groom before you go belly-to-belly for the title.
You know the drill, gents. The first wrestler to get his opponent to step outside the ring or touch the ground with anything but his feet wins the bout.
Who will join the ranks of sumo's grand champions?

Haaai!
Sumo wrestling is a stroke of genius for a stag do. We're talking fat suits, wedgies, topknots, fighting: the full works! If you're off to Edinburgh on a lads jolly, tear the boys away from West Port and battle it out for honour and glory in traditional Japanese style.

All truly great stag dos include a little healthy competition. Sumo wrestling is the ultimate trial of strength over in Japan. What's more, wrestlers are apparently irresistible to women and generally have hot wives and girlfriends. Bring on the pies!

1) Have your partner’s back
While rolling it is not uncommon to collide with other rolling pairs, the wall, the edge of the mat, the pillars, or other environmental variables. Many times, your opponent can not see these things and it is your job to be their eyes and prevent a potentially harmful condition. Stop the roll before your momentum crashes you into a bench or wall and resume your epic struggle safely in the center of the mat."
